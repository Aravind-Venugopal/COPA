This unusual CAPS deployment sequence prompted an extraordinary accident investigation. In addition to the pilot actions during the emergency, investigators studied the components of the CAPS system looking to explain an anomaly. This article appears in the January/February 2019 issue of COPA Pilot magazine.

On July 18, 2016, during a C2A formation training event, Cirrus SR22 N678Z experienced a loss of power event and deployed CAPS. The impact attitude after parachute deployment was nose-low, suggesting a low-altitude activation (see Figure 1). The three occupants all survived, although they were walking wounded.

Figure 1: Cirrus SR22 N678Z impacted the ground after a CAPS deployment due to a loss of power event. Three occupants survived the accident that became a fascinating accident investigation of a CAPS activation anomaly.
The resulting accident investigation determined that numerous factors affected the survivable outcome: the loss of power could not be replicated, suggesting an operational issue; the pilot?€?s decision to deploy CAPS was delayed by his prior training and habits; the activation was estimated at below 500 feet AGL; and the activation sequence appeared highly unusual.
The NTSB investigation invited COPA?? to participate as a party representative. As a result, I spent two years working intimately with the NTSB, Cirrus Aircraft and Continental Motors investigators, as well as the pilots involved in the C2A formation training event.
The investigation acquired unique photographic evidence that complemented other data and components recovered from the accident scene. However, not all of the CAPS components could be found, resulting in some complications in the analysis and determination of a probable cause statement.
While the NTSB has released a final report, the investigation team has requested revisions to the analysis and probable cause statements, which are currently in process.
How did the accident unfold?
This CAPS deployment at Colorado Springs happened during a C2A formation training clinic. C2A flight briefings include how to handle all of the planned formation maneuvers, as well as any emergency situations.
In this formation event, there were two aircraft and initially the accident aircraft flew as wingman. Each aircraft had three occupants: the pilot under formation training, a safety pilot and an observer. In the lead aircraft, a professional photographer flew as an observer to document the flight.
One salient point about briefing for emergencies suggested that an aircraft in distress would immediately assume lead, similar to the sobriquet ?€?If it bleeds, it leads.?€?
Upon experiencing a loss of power and difficulty maintaining altitude, the accident airplane switched positions to assume the lead then reported to ATC that they were returning to the airport about 8 miles away.
Soon it became apparent that the accident airplane would not make the airport despite having the throttle full forward. The pilot began searching for places to land the plane. The safety pilot suggested activating CAPS, but the pilot?€?s habit persisted in looking for an off-airport landing site. The safety pilot then yelled ?€?Pull CAPS!?€? so loudly that the back-seat observer could hear it without a headset! The CAPS activation fully deployed the parachute, although the ground impact had a nose-low attitude.
All three occupants egressed the airplane (see Figure 2) and managed to pull the canopy down to the ground and waited for first responders to arrive. Two had minor injuries and one was hospitalized with a transverse process fracture of a lumbar vertebrae, although two days later he flew himself back to Seattle and resumed his airline flying duties.

What evidence was available?
The wreckage of the Cirrus SR22 was recovered from the prairie and impounded in a secure facility for examination. The engine was dismounted and sent to Continental Motors for a forensic examination.
Interviews with the occupants of both airplanes in the formation flight reported the sequence of events including a delay in activation and then the unusual deployment of the parachute canopy.
Recorded engine data from the Avidyne MFD provided information about the accident flight and several earlier flights. The NTSB Vehicle Recorder Lab analyzed those data files and produced a typical report. Unfortunately, the data did not include altitude information to determine height of the CAPS activation.
Uniquely, the investigation team was given both a GPS flight track from the lead airplane and a photographic archive covering the activation, deployment and recovery of the accident airplane.
Mike Radomsky provided a CloudAhoy flight track based on a Bad Elf?? GPS device. That flight track followed the accident plane (see Figure 3) in its gradual descent (purple) until it deployed CAPS then circled for about 20-30 minutes (yellow) until first responders arrived.

Figure 3: Flight track of the second airplane in the two-ship formation that followed the accident airplane (purple) during its gradual descent and CAPS deployment then orbited the downed airplane (yellow) until the arrival of first responders.
Greg ?€?Baron von Speed?€? Akers provided an extensive photo archive of 161 high-resolution images taken from the second airplane. The raw images contained 8688 x 5792 pixels that were very useful for detailed examination.
Metadata in these photos included a time stamp to a hundredth of a second. Using that time stamp, we could interpolate the closest GPS location and altitude of the camera from the Bad Elf data file.
Engine analysis and testing
The MFD engine data file contains both the accident flight and several prior flights. These were examined and analyzed looking for evidence of a loss of power event.
The data analysis found that the oil pressure was low, ranging from 32 to 37 psi during the last 10 minutes of the flight. The fuel flow ranged from 7 to 15 gph during that time. Engine rpm ranged from 2,000 to 2,600 rpm with it slowly declining in the last two minutes of flight.
The IO-550N engine was equipped with an after-market supercharger by Forced Airmotive Technologies. The engine test conducted by Continental Motors found that the engine ran without issues on the test stand at sea level in Mobile, Alabama.
None of these tests and analyses provided a simple answer to the loss of power event. High density-altitude conditions existed during the summer flight at the elevation of Colorado Springs. From my vantage point, without any experience in operating a supercharged engine, nor flying in a wingman position in a formation flight, I wondered if the low fuel flow might have contributed to the loss of power at high rpm.
About that anomalous CAPS deployment sequence
From the earliest opportunity to view the photo archive, one photo stood out. Figure 4 shows the parachute bag (white) drooping well below the aircraft. None of us had ever seen that in a rocket-assisted CAPS deployment sequence where the parachute is extracted high above the plane to inflate in the slipstream.

Figure 4: What?! This photo shows the packed parachute bag drooping below and behind the aircraft during the CAPS deployment sequence.
Ultimately, the parachute did inflate somewhat normally. However, given the time stamps of the photos, inflation of the canopy took a few seconds longer than usual. Add the reality of a low-altitude activation and the ground impact in a nose-low attitude would be expected.
But how low???
Photo analysis by COPA
As the COPA representative, I prepared an analysis report of the photo archive to estimate the altitude of the CAPS activation. Coincidentally, the initial photos included background details of the three radar domes on the ground at Schriever Air Force base near Colorado Springs (see Figure 5).

Figure 5: Detail from one of the first photos in the deployment sequence shows the radar domes at Schriever Air Force Base. Using the altitude of the camera and the location of the radar domes, we could estimate the altitude of CAPS activation as 472 feet AGL. (Due to the circumstances of the event, some photos had camera shake.)
Using those radar domes and the data from the camera, we could triangulate the position and altitude of the camera with the radar domes. Then by estimating the position of the accident aircraft, we could compute the altitude of the CAPS deployment as approximately 472 feet AGL immediately after activation.
Collecting components of the CAPS system
Typical of any accident investigation, the four corners of the aircraft are located. With the wreckage mostly intact, that was easy.
For a CAPS deployment, the investigators want to collect all of the components of the CAPS system that separate from the airplane: CAPS cover, rocket, lanyard, incremental bridle and parachute deployment bag.
The first responders found the white parachute deployment bag. Although they didn?€?t mark where it was found, examining the photo archive revealed that it was only a few hundred feet from the wreckage.
However, that parachute bag was missing a few key components. Normally, the bag is connected to the rocket using a yellow Kevlar incremental bridle and a wire lanyard that goes to the pickup collar that fits around the rocket. The incremental bridle was attached to the bag but the wire lanyard was broken, with the rocket and pickup collar missing. We wanted to find the rocket and pickup collar, as well as the CAPS cover.
To find the CAPS components on the flat grassy prairie, we combined both a foot-search (the owner refused permission to drive on the prairie to avoid damaging the grass) and a photo search using a professional drone operator found through COPA connections.
The locations of the other components could be much farther away, especially the rocket. We estimated that the search area might be a trapezoid up to 1.5 miles along the route of flight and extending up to 1 mile wide.
Some items were easy to locate. The white CAPS cover is big enough that the drone found it visually and the team recovered it quickly (see Figure 6). The other missing components were a bit more challenging. One item caught my eye as we were walking our search path ?€? the Teflon cable sheath from the wire lanyard between the rocket and the incremental bridle. It was just lying on the ground.

Figure 6: The CAPS cover was big enough and white enough to be easily found.
Drone search for the rocket
The key missing piece was the rocket ?€? a red aluminum cylinder about 8 inches long and 3 inches in diameter, likely to be found anywhere in the specified trapezoid from the wreckage site.
Ultimately, we obtained 3,500 photos and used an image-processing firm to look for clusters of red pixels. Despite having numerous targets that found red fence posts and even a Coke can, there was no rocket.
Fractured CAPS lanyard examined by NTSB Materials Lab
The key mystery from the anomalous CAPS deployment by N678Z was the broken wire lanyard. We didn?€?t have the rocket or the pickup collar but we did have two pieces of the wire cable that normally looped around the rocket.
The NTSB Materials Lab investigated the broken wire and compared it to test samples provided by Cirrus Aircraft. They used a scanning electron microscope to examine the properties in the fracture and the metal deposits made from the pickup color assembly. These tests determined that the fracture locations were consistent with the small radius support holes in the pickup collar (see left item in Figure 7).

Figure 7: Two versions of the CAPS pickup collar that attaches to the rocket and carries the lanyard through the support holes and around the collar. Left part is the original design and the right part is the design introduced with the 3600-pound gross weight parachute, also used in all electronic ignition CAPS assemblies since 2013.
Cirrus Aircraft had previously modified the design of the pickup collar to accommodate the heavier parachute in the 3,600-pound gross weight SR22/SR22T models (see right item in Figure 7). The improved part has a larger radius support for the wire lanyard and is used in all electronic ignition CAPS assemblies.
What do I think happened?
There seems to be two things that happened coincidentally in this accident:
1.???????? The pilot?€?s delayed activation of CAPS resulted in a low-altitude deployment below 500 feet AGL providing insufficient time to land level under canopy.
2.???????? The CAPS rocket fractured the wire lanyard during extraction of the parachute deployment bag resulting in a delayed (by only a couple of seconds) inflation of the parachute canopy.
None of the photographs show the rocket. The first image with the activation sequence shows the CAPS cover (shown extreme left of Figure 8). Upon close examination, one sees the yellow incremental bridle flopping behind the plane, as if it was recoiling from the broken lanyard.

Figure 8: Obscure first photograph shows the CAPS cover off to the far left in the image. Unfortunately, the photographer was surprised by the pilot?€?s delay to activate CAPS, so no images of the rocket were captured.
The next image suggests that the parachute bag has plopped onto the horizontal stabilizer. Subsequent images show the parachute bag dropping behind and below the plane, eventually releasing the canopy that inflated normally.
Safety Recommendations to NTSB
As a party to the investigation, I submitted the following safety recommendations for their consideration:
1.???????? Use the final report to inform Cirrus pilots that Cirrus Aircraft has redesigned the rocket pickup collar.
2.???????? Consider habit interference that affected the pilot?€?s decision to activate the CAPS parachute system.
3.???????? Recognize the distraction and stress from the formation training clinic scenario.
Redesigned rocket pickup collar
Any Cirrus airplane with the electronic ignition assembly already contains the revised design of the pickup collar (see Figure 7). That new design alleviates the stress on the lanyard and reduces the possibility of a similar fracture.
By the end of 2018, Cirrus Aircraft reports that 75 percent of the Cirrus fleet incorporates this updated design. Due to the 10-year repack schedule, the remaining aircraft will be retrofitted from 2019 to 2023.
Habit interference
Using the NTSB Aviation Coding Manual for identifying factors in an accident, I suggested adding the human factors finding ?€?31000 Psychological Condition / 31270 Habit Interference.?€?
In the public investigation docket, the back-seat observer includes this detail:
[The pilot] appeared to be looking for a suitable landing site in the directions of Springs East and Bullseye airports. [The pilot] then reached up and removed the CAPS handle cover and tilted the handle down still looking around the area. I again looked at the MFD and saw 56 percent power with the throttle full forward. [The safety pilot] then yelled, ?€?Pull it now!?€? [The pilot] then pulled the handle.
Subsequently, the safety pilot provided additional detail that was included in the factual report:
The safety pilot reported that the pilot in command would pull the CAPS unless incapacitated, as briefed during preflight briefing. According to the safety pilot, the pilot?€?s previous and overriding training habit kicked in as he looked for a place to land. The pilot verified with the safety pilot that he intended to deploy the CAPS and pulled the CAPS handle at the safety pilot?€?s second request.
That reference to habit suggests an important pilot-training aspect of this investigation: overcoming habits learned in prior flying through a suitable transition training program to flying a CAPS-equipped airplane.
Self-induced pressure
To help pilot training, another finding from human factors would be the addition of ?€?31000 Psychological Condition / 31201 Self-Induced Pressure.?€? Kudos to the organizers of the C2A formation flying clinics who subsequently expanded their preflight briefings to acknowledge the additional pressure of learning to fly in a formation.
What You Can Do
This accident investigation involved several interesting paths that come back to how a Cirrus pilot handles an in-flight emergency.
Have you developed the habit of ?€?Consider CAPS?€??
We recommend that every Cirrus pilot develop habits that promote the use of CAPS during an emergency. Add a first step to each emergency procedure:
Step 0. CAPS ?€? Consider
As well, we recommend using the departure briefing found in the Flight Operations Manual. Add the practice of reaching up and grasping (but not pulling) the CAPS handle when you climb to the CAPS-viable altitude for your plane. This helps develop muscle memory that may make consideration of CAPS more likely in your emergency.
Stress and distraction
A possible factor in this accident was the additional stress and distraction of flying a formation training event. Would you recognize the extra energy and nervousness involved in any training mission? How would you mitigate that stress and distraction?
High altitude operations are different
Another aspect of this accident involves flight in an area of hot and high conditions. The density altitude was several thousand feet higher than the terrain elevation. Consequently, engine operations need to be different, consistent with your engine model, whether normally aspirated or boosted with a turbo or supercharger. Familiarize yourself with how best to handle hot and high conditions.

by Rick Beach, COPA Safety Chair
A recent thread on the COPA forum posed the topic of when to deploy CAPS, the Cirrus parachute system. If you lose engine power during a departure climb, when can you pull? When should you pull?
COPA and Cirrus both advocate a callout of ?€?CAPS and FLAPS?€? when the parachute system becomes viable.
How high is CAPS viable? And how low can you go before you risk serious or fatal injuries?
How Low?
Overwhelming data show that CAPS activations higher than 1,000 feet above the ground are survivable. No one has died.
Below that, the outcome becomes problematic.
How High?
A few hundred feet has proven not enough to survive. Activation low to the ground has resulted in 15 fatalities in eight accidents.

528 feet in a spin at Indianapolis, Ind. in 2006 (1 fatality)
Less than 50 feet in a spin at Deltona, Fla. in 2009 (2 fatalities)
Less than 200 feet after fuel exhaustion at Carrollton, Texas in 2011 (1 fatality)
Low altitude pulls in the traffic pattern at Waxhaw, N.C. in 2008; Asturias, Spain in 2011; Melbourne, Fla. in 2012; Lanseria, South Africa in 2013 (8 fatalities total)

Know your Aircraft: The G5 is Different
Pilots need to know their aircraft. The oft-quoted loss of 400 feet in level flight and 920 feet in a one-and-a-half turn spin refer to the certification of the SR20 and SR22/SR22T, prior to the G5.
The SR22 G5, with the increased gross weight to 3,600 pounds, required a larger diameter parachute, heavier packed parachute, and more powerful rocket. The numbers for the loss of altitude in a G5 CAPS deployment have increased.
The G5 deployment sequence also differs because the line cutters delay longer. People noticed how long the plane was in a nose-low attitude in the Coast Guard video of Lue Morton?€?s CAPS deployment near Hawaii.
Plan accordingly.
Lue Morton?€?s CAPS deployment near Hawaii, shows a longer nose-low attitude position in a G5 SR22.
Pitch-down, Nose-low Attitude is a Design Feature
By the way, the engineers designed CAPS to induce a nose-low attitude immediately after deployment. The extra drag in that attitude helps decelerate the extra mass and speed of a Cirrus. The line cutters delay unfolding the rear riser to keep the plane in that high-drag configuration while it slows down, yet enables it to land in a level attitude.
You need to give the system time to fully operate.
What We Know from Data
Certification tests gave us data in a limited set of configurations. Investigations of Cirrus parachute deployments provide us with data from additional scenarios. Overwhelmingly, most CAPS deployments happen high enough to fully deploy, but a worrisome and recent trend shows more deployments below 500 feet with more injuries.
The lowest survivable CAPS deployment, based on released NTSB data, was at 386 feet AGL in level flight near Idabel, Okla., during a loss of engine power event. The passenger received a minor injury. Both pilot and passenger reported that the plane impacted the ground coincident with the tail dropping level.
Two other accidents still under investigation appear to have been even lower deployments and involved more serious injuries.
Investigators have told us that preliminary data showed one deployment at 325 AGL in an SR22 G3 at Texarkana, AR in 2013. From observations in Cirrus simulators, such a low-altitude pull seems way lower than a planned deployment, more consistent with a panic last-moment reaction.
Glad that it worked out and the pilot survived without injury. But without sufficient time or altitude for the CAPS system to fully deploy, hence decelerate the plane, you will hit something with more energy than need be. Pull early!
We do not need more test pilots!
Lower altitude pulls have more serious injuries and even fatalities. We have enough data on low altitude pulls. Please do not go for the record!
Your Attitude Matters
If you have an attitude that CAPS is not for you, then you can ignore this article. (I?€?m kidding.)
If you consider the attitude of your airplane and when to deploy, then read on!
1) Low-altitude dive attitude
Most of the fatalities in CAPS deployments occurred in a dive with the pull very low, perhaps 50 to 200 feet above the ground.
Given that the rocket extracts the parachute (two seconds), the risers fully extend (to 90 feet), the canopy inflates (several seconds as slider keeps the opening symmetrical), and the line cutters delay the tail drop (six to 10 seconds), it takes time to come down level under canopy.
In a dive, you are decreasing your altitude and hence your time for deceleration. Pull early, before you get too low.
2) Low-altitude level flight
In level flight, things work better. Still, you need to pull before you stall since that induces a loss of altitude you may need.
Curiously, faster airspeeds result in shorter deployment times, while slower airspeeds result in longer deployment times. The Hawaii pull was at about 80 knots and took longer than the highest airspeed pull of 190 knots.
The CAPS procedure has changed:
1) Remove cover
2) Pull handle
No longer does it involve slowing down. If you need CAPS, just pull!
3) Low-altitude departure climb
Fortunately, we do not have many examples of this. Unfortunately, we don?€?t have good data.
This is the scenario for the callout ?€?CAPS and FLAPS?€? when you reach a CAPS-viable altitude.
A climb attitude can trade airspeed for altitude, but you have to act deliberately and quickly.
Build a habit with a departure briefing for when you will deploy CAPS and build muscle memory by grasping the CAPS handle at the callout (no need to pull, but do more than just point or touch the handle).
4) Deceleration effect of deploying CAPS
Wear your seatbelts at all times. We have data on what happens. At high airspeeds, the data shows up to 4Gs of instant deceleration when CAPS first slows the airplane. Good for reducing energy, bad for bouncing you around the cockpit if you are not securely fastened.
The CAPS deployment sequence takes time. Just four seconds earlier in that 528-foot Indianapolis spin may have been sufficient to reduce the impact energy and not have killed the pilot.
Boris Popov, the inventor of the ballistic recovery parachute system, advocates deploying the parachute prior to impact. He asks: Why die with a perfectly good parachute behind you?
Part of his thinking is based on what we know and what we don?€?t know. We know that CAPS will decelerate the plane. We don?€?t know precisely how low or how fast or at what attitude we pull. So give it your best effort. You may avoid a high-energy crash.
Better to pull early, so plan ahead.
Departure Procedure
COPA encourages every COPA Pilot to brief CAPS during a departure briefing.
As you hold short of the runway, review the runway heading, the winds, say the airspeed if you will abort the takeoff on the runway, say the altitude when CAPS becomes viable, and say that you will deploy CAPS if you lose engine power.
As you climb, monitor your altitude. At your CAPS-viable altitude, say the callout ?€?CAPS and FLAPS?€? and grasp the handle.
Build the muscle memory you may need. Say things out loud. Tell yourself and your passengers. Make it real.
Pull Early, Pull Often!
Pull early ?€? before you get too low.
Pull often ?€? in more situations than you might expect.

Reach the Unreachable
Safety in the Cirrus fleet has improved with a reduction of fatal accidents and an increase in survivable parachute deployments. However, an uptick in recent fatal accidents belies our progress. Consequently, we know that there are pilots and owners out there who are not participating in our safety programs. So, how do we reach the unreachable?
Low time-in-type vs low time-of-ownership
We have known from tracking Cirrus fatal accidents that about half of the accident pilots had less than 200 hours of time-in-type. Experience matters.
Recently, we discovered a new category of pilot experience: low time-of-ownership resulting in accidents in the traffic pattern with instructors on board.
Recent fatal accidents with low time of ownership
Here are some examples.

In early 2015, an owner new to his Cirrus of 9 weeks with about 40 hours of time-in-type departed his airport, got disoriented in low-visibility weather, then crashed into the shallow Great Salt Lake in Utah. The pilot died.


In February 2016, an owner new to his Cirrus of 1 week was practicing with his instructor and crashed in the traffic pattern. The instructor had zero time in a Cirrus. Four people on board all died.??


In April 2017, an owner new to his Cirrus of 3 weeks was practicing touch-and-goes with his son, bounced two landings and skidded across the ramp, through a fence, and caught fire when it hit a berm on the other side of a road. The pilot died and his son was extracted with serious injuries.


In June 2017, an owner new to his Cirrus of 8 weeks encountered difficulty and crashed with serious injuries to the pilot and right-seat passenger.

In each of those accidents, I wonder who signed them off to fly their Cirrus?
How many used Cirrus airplanes change hands each year?
One of the first questions I wanted to explore was how many used Cirrus airplanes change ownership each year?
Our magazine publisher, Village Press, analyzes the FAA registration database to identify change of ownership so COPA can send invitations to join COPA.
Each year, there are about 800 changes.
We know Cirrus delivers about 300 new aircraft.?? Those new owners receive transition training from Cirrus Aircraft.
Three of the largest brokers sell about 250 used aircraft each year. That leaves about 250 used aircraft sold by smaller brokers or owner-to-owner sales.
What kind of transition training do those 500 new owners of used aircraft utilize?
If they hire instructors who are part of the global training partner network run by Cirrus Aircraft, then they have access to substantial transition training resources.
If they hire local instructors or the ones that last trained them, we have no idea what resources they utilize?
Despite offers of transition training, no sale
One frustrating aspect to some of these low-time-of-ownership accidents has been discovering the failed attempts to encourage Cirrus transition training.
In one case, attempts were made by the broker, the training center where the pre-buy inspection was done, even the ferry pilot who flew the plane to the new owner. All attempts were rejected. The new owner apparently planned to use a local CFI with some experience flying a Cirrus. I have yet to determine if that CFI had any dual-instruction given in a Cirrus.
In another case, local COPA members discovered that the new owner had been seeking a lower-cost alternative to Cirrus-experienced instructors.
This suggests that new owners of used aircraft have several objections to Cirrus transition training.
What are the barriers?
It didn?€?t take long to brainstorm a set of barriers that might explain the lack of Cirrus transition training.
Economics?
An old G1 Cirrus SR22, like mine, can be bought for less than $200,000.
That?€?s an affordable price for some. Others form a partnership with 2-3 owners to make the purchase feasible.
Do they then have sufficient funds to engage Cirrus transition training? Perhaps not.
Ego?
In one of my examples above, the broker reported that the new owner rejected transition training with the explanation ?€?It?€?s just a single-engine low-wing airplane, so I can handle that.?€? Within a couple of months, he was dead.
Capacity of Cirrus training network?:
Cirrus Aircraft manages a network of experienced Cirrus instructors who are committed to following standardized procedures.
Cirrus Training Centers (CTC): these instructors conform to the requirements of their Chief Instructor and are routinely audited by Cirrus regional training managers. There are 91 CTC centers in 11 countries.
Platinum Cirrus Standardized Instructor Pilots (Platinum CSIPs): these instructors are distinguished at a higher level of experience with lots of hours of Cirrus dual-given instruction, expertise with Cirrus avionics suites, engagement in promoting Cirrus and general aviation, and factory trained and audited. There are 80 Platinum CSIPs in 10 countries.
Cirrus Standardized Instructor Pilots (CSIPs): these instructors are factory trained who commit to using Cirrus training resources for their clients. There are approximately 350 CSIPs around the world.
But, for all of that capacity in the training network, are they fully booked? Do they have the capacity for the 500 new owners each year? And are they located in places convenient to the new owners?
Insurance lack of transition requirements?
Some people suggest that getting insurance for your new Cirrus should require transition training.
As Part 91 pilots, we have the freedom to choose many aspects of how we fly. One of them is choice of insurance underwriter.
We know a couple of underwriters do not require transition training per the Cirrus syllabus, just a checkout of a few hours.
We also know that some COPA members resist restrictions imposed on them by underwriters and hence seek out lower-cost premiums with fewer requirements on them.
We know that a few of these low-time-in-ownership fatal accidents were with those underwriters.
Knowing the problem is the first step to a solution
This column states what I know of the problem. Unfortunately, many things are not yet known, such as which of those barriers really exist with those new owners of used aircraft.??
Consequently, we are working on a proposal to conduct a study with a sample of new owners by a professional service. We want to ask the question and learn why new owners avoid things that would keep them safe.

3,"?€?That Sounds Expensive?€? -- It Happened to Me, Could It Happen to You?",Rick Beach,10/15/2018 4:22,,"This column will appear in the Nov/Dec 2018 issue of COPA Pilot magazine. It reflects on an accident with my Cirrus SR22. Writing this column has been more difficult because it happened to me. Most of the time, I act as a detached observer, looking at photos of wreckage and discerning what happened. In this event, things are different. Personal and emotional reactions flood over me disrupting my normal flow of logic and analysis. After a bit of struggle, here is my personal story about a significant event in my flying experience.
?€?Cirrus N858CD experienced a runway excursion in Canada?€?
That?€?s the way I started my call to my insurance broker on August 2, 2018. I was reporting an event at a grass strip near my family?€?s island retreat because my airplane impacted trees off the runway.
I took photos of damage to the wing tip, rudder, leading edge, main landing gear, prop strike and fuselage. My instant assessment was that the aircraft was beyond repair, but I was totally unfamiliar with the process of making such a claim.
The Event
After Oshkosh, I flew to Ontario, Canada, to spend a couple of weeks on the island where my family owns a share in several cottages. I cleared customs near Ottawa then relocated to a grass strip at Rideau Lakes Airfield (CRL2), which was closer to the local boat dock for the trip to the island.
To entice my 86-year old uncle to attend, I offered to fly him and his 65-year old friend from Montreal to the Rideau Lakes so they could avoid a three-hour drive.

Pilots are poor witnesses, as they know too much
Having participated in several accident investigations, we joke that pilots are poor witnesses ?€? because they know too much. They quickly shift from reporting what they observed and what they did to what they think happened and why. While retelling my story, I frequently caught myself doing exactly that: it is so tempting to jump to conclusions!
What I recall observing
The flight from Montreal (CYHU) to Rideau Lakes Airfield (CRL2) was uneventful until landing. I had landed there perhaps 10 times over the years, including the day before, and felt confident of landing my SR22 on the grass runway.
Runway 25 at Rideau Lakes Airfield (CRL2) near Westport, Ontario, Canada, on the shore of Upper Rideau Lake, showing most of the 3,118-foot runway. Note the gravel center of the runway starts about a third down the runway. Also, the trees that were hit off the runway appear at the bottom-left of the photo.
We joined the traffic pattern in the normal way for Canadian airports, crossing midfield, checking the wind sock and flying downwind over the lake for final on runway 25. The winds were variable crosswinds but the wind sock was not straight out, so perhaps 10 knots max.
As I touched down, the airplane was slightly left of centerline and felt like it had been pushed by a crosswind gust. My control inputs, right brake and right rudder, could not bring it back to the centerline. The aircraft drifted inexorably to the left in a slight curve towards tall grass and weeds. I recall powering up just before leaving the left side of the runway in an attempt to gain rudder authority and go around; nothing I did changed the leftward drift off the runway.
The airplane rolled in the tall grass and weeds towards trees. I don?€?t recall the first hit with the left wingtip, but I recall N858CD rotated 90 degrees and slid sideways deeper into a copse of trees. As it came to a rest, I recall it titling up and heard a crunching sound.
My instant exclamation is the title of this story: ?€?That sounds expensive!?€? Immediately, I checked with my uncle and his friend ?€? everyone was okay, no injuries, no discomforts, just a bit of shock. My uncle?€?s friend did admit that she closed her eyes!
We exited the airplane through the pilot door and gathered our belongings. We then took pictures, made our way to the car and drove to our boat dock for the family weekend at our island retreat.
What happened? Shifting from observations to analysis
The next day, I returned to survey the damage and try to assess what had happened.
The runway has a mix of turf and gravel. In the direction that I landed, the first third is all turf and sometimes soft, except I had walked it before I relocated and it was firm and dry. The next third has a gravel center while the last third is all gravel across the width of the runway.
The grass had been mowed, but I noticed that with the crowned shape of the runway, the center was quite thin and the edges were much thicker with lush green grass. The wheel track showed a consistent, shallow, left turn towards the edge. No obvious skid marks or ruts.
I found the first tree that the N858CD hit about five feet inboard of the tip (see Figure 1).
Figure 1: First point of impact, a tree that sent the plane skidding sideways into the trees beyond. A piece of composite remained impaled in the tree trunk.
The most obvious damage was a broken wingtip (Figure 2).
Figure 2: The most obvious damage was to the left wing, where the wingtip was broken off from impact with a tree.
That included a section of destroyed top skin, bottom skin, leading edge and had exposed the last couple of feet of wing spar (Figure 3).
Figure 3: Close-up of wing damage that compromised the spar and resulted in an opinion from Cirrus engineering that the wing was not repairable. Oh, and Cirrus no longer makes wings for G1 or G2 aircraft!
I documented the damage to the left wing and noticed that the rudder was bent from impacting a tree; the right wing had about four feet of crunched leading edge resting against a tree; the wheel pants were broken; and the prop tips were bent. The more concerning issue was subtle damage to the fuselage (Figure 4) where the wing attaches to the aft carry-through torsion-box. The CAPS channel cover was separated and the wing walk crunched as we exited the plane, clearly no longer firmly attached.
Figure 4: Subtle damage to the fuselage where the wing attaches to the interior torsion box.
Eventually, I took a picture of the fractured floor that forms the aft carry-through torsion-box under the rear passenger seat behind the pilot (Figure 5). This would not be a simple (or cheap) repair as it requires replacing the whole floor, something that only a few shops could do.
Figure 5: The floor crack under the left rear passenger seat that represents an expensive and complicated repair.
For a low-speed runway excursion, this added up to a lot of issues suggesting a major repair bill, if in fact it was at all repairable.
Insurance claim
Knowing what I didn?€?t know, I contacted my insurance broker immediately in California. They initiated the claim and I soon received a call back from the claims representative from Starr Aviation Insurance (see the COPA Member advantage program sponsored by Starr). He walked me through the process, sent me a request for some preliminary documentation, and suggested that a claims adjuster from northern New York would contact me. That left me wondering how cross-border claims would work in Canada ?€?
The next day, a local claims adjuster in Ontario contacted me and we started the whole process. I began collecting my documents and writing the accident reports. What surprised me was that one day later, on a Saturday, he flew in with a recovery team to get my airplane out of the trees and properly assess the damage.
Recovery
With the aircraft nestled in the trees, I expected to have to cut some down to get it out. Nope; the recovery team strapped the main landing gear together and then used a longer strap to the airfield tractor to pull the airplane out sideways (Figure 6).
Figure 6: Preparing the straps and plywood skids to pull the plane out of the trees.
Within the hour, N858CD was pulled sideways onto the runway then towed into a secure hangar (Figure 7).
Figure 7: N858CD, damaged, but secure in a hangar. Note that it only fit because the wing was now several feet shorter.
Paperwork
Despite being a straightforward process, completing the paperwork became an unfamiliar and stressful experience. I wondered how to answer their questions to achieve the best result. Was the airplane repairable? Did my actions influence their decision? Was the hull value too high, so they would decide on a lengthy repair?
Most documents requested were handy so I simply scanned them with my phone (thanks to the Scanbot app) and others I already had in electronic form (thanks to SavvyMX):

Registration
Airworthiness certificate
Pilot certificate
Medical certificate
Weight and balance
Maintenance logbook entries
Accident data and contact info for passengers

Then things became a bit uneasy: a statement of what happened.
Eventually, I wrote ?€?Pilot failed to maintain directional control and airplane left runway then hit trees.?€? The claims adjuster remarked that it sounds brutal, but it?€?s what I expected an accident investigation would determine, in this case, my own!
COPA Support
Despite being on an island in eastern Ontario in Canada, I still had access to COPA and its generous and knowledgeable members. Who better to assess reparability to my Cirrus than those who do major repairs?
I sent my photo album (thanks Dropbox) to Ross Robillard of Midwest Aircraft Refinishing and asked for his assessment. Within a couple of hours, he replied that it looked like a total loss and he included a reference to Cirrus engineering, whom he had contacted to look at my wing damage photo, because they determined it was unrepairable.
Surprisingly, that simple communication provided a huge relief. Just like I have seen many times before in COPA, help comes quickly and generously. Thanks, Ross. Oh, and Cirrus noted that they no longer make G1 or G2 wings!
???€?That sounds expensive!?€? as coping mechanism
I made that statement as a reflex response to the accident. It was so matter-of-fact that my uncle remarked later how ?€?serene?€? I was about the event. He admitted waking up the next morning acutely aware that it could have been much worse. Yet, none of us were hurt, not even strained necks the morning after.
My family cross-examined me during lunch about what happened, why it happened, what about the parachute, what about Cirrus accidents, how investigations happen, and more. Frankly, I enjoyed the discussions as it kept me in that detached observer mindset. It kept me from dwelling on a traumatic event.
Still, that exclamation telegraphed another realization that occurred to me as the plane was coming to a stop ?€? this would become a significant transition for me in my aviation life. What next?
Trauma happens even when we?€?re not physically injured
From talking with several COPA Pilots who survived CAPS pulls or other accidents, I?€?ve seen the delayed effects of mental anguish and psychological trauma. I have coached several of them to give themselves permission and time to deal with the upset. Now I needed to apply that to myself. Easy to say, not so easy to do!
One big issue for me was the uncertainty of the insurance claim process. If the airplane was repairable, then I knew it would be a lengthy time to get it back. If the plane was totaled, what would I do with a big check?
I jokingly told people that I had three real options:

Get a big check and buy a cheap replacement
Get a big check and rent.
Get a big check and stop flying.
Have a drink and decide later.

Everyone helped me choose option 4!
Still, on numerous occasions, I found myself replaying the event knowing that something I did or did not do contributed to the bad outcome.
Many of those thoughts were stressful:

Why did I let the airplane land off to the left of centerline?
Did I only use the right brake or was I pushing the right rudder pedal all the way?
Why did I attempt to power out of the runway excursion?
What else could have gone wrong and more severely injured my uncle and his friend?
What was my future in aviation safety now that I had totaled my own airplane?

I had to repeatedly give myself permission to allow these thoughts to wash over me and dissipate. It took effort, and it?€?s still not complete two months later.
Could this happen to you?
Okay, I had an accident. Pilots make mistakes. But the safety guru from COPA? Really?
Having flown thousands of hours in my Cirrus, traveled across the country into many airports big and small, taught at over 100 CPPP weekend events, participated in several accident investigations, it seems obvious that I?€?m no longer a newbie or inexperienced pilot. Yet, here I am dealing with putting an airplane in the trees and it will never fly again.
One line of thinking raises the question: if this could happen to me, could it happen to you?
I believe that I did not handle landing on that grass strip correctly. Why land off the centerline ?€? anytime? While I had lots of experience in other things, grass strips were close to the edge of my envelope of safety. I had experience in well-groomed grass strips and not the vagaries of this one.
What You Can Do
Please forgive this lengthy article. It has been part of my process to dealing with this significant transition.
If I may, here are some suggestions for you. Foremost, please realize that your envelope of safety may have some sharp edges. Mine did. Also, consider your personality, if you can humbly declare ?€?this is more than I know how to handle.?€? I thought I was willing and prepared to go-around, except I left it too late in this accident. Would you?
Finally, appreciate that you are surrounded by people who will be affected by what happens to you. Family, friends, co-workers, community acquaintances, COPA members, lots and lots of people whom you probably don?€?t realize care about what happens.
Fly safely. Fly humbly.

This June 2017 issue of COPA Pilot magazine represents an opportunity to expand??from a bi-monthly publication by adding two special issues, this one on safety.
The tradition of a special issue on safety began about 10 years ago. Those early issues brought?? forward the?? need to reduce accidents and discussed ways to keep pilots safe. Now, we have a great story to tell about fewer fatal accidents, more parachute survivors, and an expanded portfolio of training resources.
Success has Many Fathers, Failure is an Orphan
This sobriquet applies to the many contributors who worked reduce Cirrus accidents. No single person did this. It took a collaborative effort of several hundred people to align on a vision of fewer accidents.
It began with innovators at Cirrus Aircraft who brought safety features to the market. The reality surprised many because these innovations were by themselves not immediately effective, but they proved to establish the foundation for long-term improvement.
It took many more minds to change things for the better.
Innovators within COPA championed safety programs like the  COPA Pilot Proficiency Program (CPPP), Critical Decision Making seminar (CDM), and now COPA University.
Insurance brokers and underwriters who valued those efforts reinforced the commitment to safety.
NTSB investigation teams dug into the details of accidents so we could learn what happened and develop training interventions.
COPA members who generously shared their talent and insights when discussing accidents created powerful teachable moments.
CPPP instructors who championed standardizing of procedures, promoted the training network, and became the core of outstanding professional educators in the Cirrus community.
The resources available now represent a unique and outstanding portfolio to keep you safe. See the list on the next page.
We Are Not Done Yet
Accidents keep happening, so we need to remain vigilant and undeterred.
Fortunately, people who participate in COPA and who attend our training programs do not often show up in fatal accidents. No CPPP participant has died in a Cirrus fatal accident in almost four years, yet we see too many fatal accidents among the pilots who buy a Cirrus and do not participate in COPA or the Cirrus training network.
Our commitment within COPA to improving flight safety and sustaining general aviation requires us to keep the focus on doing more. We created COPA University to expand our training programs. We established the COPA Safety and Education Foundation to fund development of new materials.
We are not done yet.
You Can Help
COPA depends upon the passion and talent of volunteers like you.
If you had a great experience, write it up and post a testimonial.
If you have ideas to spread the word, post some marketing concepts.
If you wish to instruct or present at our programs, let us know and get involved.
All of us who have fathered these safety improvements did so because we wanted to, because of our passions and energy.
We welcome yours.
You can contribute
Charitable contributions to the COPA Safety and Education Foundation fund the development of new materials and programs. Those funds serve as the capital investment for COPA University.
Many generous donors helped us to get this far. We need more to push forward.

Training Resources for COPA Pilots
The COPA culture of safety emerges from the collective actions of COPA Pilots who aspire to be safer pilots. COPA and Cirrus Approach?????provide resources that help answer questions, maintain proficiency and gain knowledge. Please use these resources to improve your flying and enhance our culture of safety.

COPA Code of Conduct
This booklet outlines commitments that COPA members can make to improve safety. The Code of Conduct presents a vision of excellence in general aviation to improve flight safety and to sustain the community.
Paper copies are handed out at COPA events. A PDF version is found on the COPA website under the Safety menu tab, under Safety Resources.
Critical Decision Making Seminar (CDM)
Attend a half-day fly-in safety discussion. The facilitated dialog encourages group knowledge to emerge that changes safety behaviors. Pilots report great value from hearing how other pilots handle challenging situations, always with new insights and knowledge.
CDM events appear on the COPA website under the??Safety & Training Events calendar.
 COPA Pilot Proficiency Program (CPPP)
COPA University holds weekend recurrent training events around the world. The colleges in COPA University present courses on safety, flight operations, avionics, and aircraft technology. Simulator sessions
provide practical scenarios to use the knowledge gained. Flight instruction sessions reinforce the skills needed for flying proficiently. The Partner in Command course for right-seat flyers ensures that they know what to expect and how to handle pilot incapacitation in a Cirrus.
Social interactions among COPA Pilots and their partners with some of the most knowledgeable Cirrus instructors helps build connections and reinforce safety.
CPPP events also appear on the COPA website under the Safety & Training Events calendar.
COPA University Channel on YouTube
Expanding our portfolio of training resources includes the new COPA University channel on YouTube. These videos educate, entertain, and entice. They link to the COPA discussion forums and COPA University training events.
iFOM
The interactive Flight Operations Manual emphasizes procedural standardization when flying a Cirrus. The content describes checklist procedures, animates flight profiles, and demonstrates procedures through videos and interactive diagrams.
The iFOM can be acquired via the iBooks store and works well on tablets and laptops.
Cirrus Learning Portal
A wealth of Cirrus training resources lives on the Cirrus Learning Portal. Free material emphasizes the use of CAPS, the Landing Standardization course, and recurrent training syllabi. Fee-based material provides ground knowledge for transition training and differences for step-up models.
Get into the Learning Portal with the help of an instructor who is part of the global Cirrus training partner network.
Training Network of CSIPs and CTC
Cirrus Approach???, the training department of Cirrus Aircraft, promotes a global network of training providers. Deliveries of new aircraft include factory training. Recurrent and transition training for used Cirrus aircraft can be provided by independent Cirrus Standardized Instructor Pilots (CSIP) or instructors at Cirrus Training Centers (CTC). All of these training partners commit to using and following the standardized procedures that keep COPA Pilots safe.

Critical Incident Response for the COPA Community
Perhaps you read the annual safety issue of COPA Pilot magazine, Vol. 14, No. 5, June 2019. If so, then you know that a major emphasis was the aftermath of a CAPS pull ?€? the issue contained five articles by survivors of CAPS pulls.
Prompted by reading ?€?From the Right Seat: After the Save ?€? A Search for Healing?€? by Denean Richards, we heard from a COPA member who suggested we explore using the Critical Incident Response Program (CIRP) to help our peers deal with stressful incidents.

After the Save ?€? A Search for Healing?€? by Denean Richards in the June issue of COPA Pilot, COPA member Terry Lutz suggested the organization look into starting a Critical Incident Response Program (CIRP).
The COPA Community Cares
That suggestion for a program to support other COPA members matches my experience of how well the COPA community cares.

When COPA Member Manfred Stolle died at Moncks Corner in 2009, other members contributed to an education fund for his young daughter.
When Stuart McClay-Smith attempted suicide in his Cirrus in 2013, COPA Member Pierre Redmond visited him in the hospital over several days and read to him the many COPA posts wishing him a speedy recovery.
John Fiscus created a CPPP course on the Psychology of Emergencies to help us understand the stress reactions that kept pilots in the simulator from following emergency procedures and deploying CAPS.

Our annual safety issue has expanded from statistics and lessons-learned toward dealing with the emotional aftermath of Cirrus events.
The suggestion for CIRP came from Terry Lutz, a COPA member who flies an SR20 and is a CSIP independent instructor. But it was from Terry?€?s involvement as a test pilot in the Society of Experimental Test Pilots (SETP) that he knew CIRP had the structure and resources to establish within COPA a peer support program for Cirrus pilots, their partners and families.
?€?Simply being there with the right knowledge makes a huge difference in people?€?s lives. It works in the flight test community and I know that it will work within COPA.?€?
Another shining example of the caring COPA community.
Terry?€?s suggestion led me to COPA director Erik Gundersen who was familiar with CIRP from his days as a Delta pilot. Erik quickly gained approval to turn this into an opportunity for me to attend a CIRP training event and begin the exploration of how this might work within COPA.
Critical Incident Response Program
Aviation advocates initiated CIRP in the pilot?€?s union, ALPA (Air Line Pilots Association), as a response to the Aloha 243 event, where a large portion of the upper fuselage separated from the airplane.
Subsequently, CIRP groups have formed within several major airlines, cargo carriers, as well as the test pilot and test engineer communities within manufacturers. The program offers peer support to mitigate the psychological impact of an accident or incident and to aid in the normal recovery from these events before stress reactions affect job performance, families and health.
The CIRP training arms volunteers with the information and practices to help crewmembers who have been involved in a critical incident. Those volunteers learn to listen, focus on what survivors are experiencing and suggest means of coping with their stress reactions.
A crucial aspect of CIRP involves peers assisting peers?€? pilots helping pilots, engineers helping engineers, spouses helping spouses. Importantly, CIRP volunteers do not cross over into psychological counseling or mental health services, which may be handled by referrals to professionals.
When an incident happens, notification within the company triggers the CIRP chair to invite volunteers to assist. All interactions are confidential and secure, with no notes taken, no recordings made, no information shared. Peer support volunteers avoid taking on logistical tasks to remain focused on the well-being of the affected peer.
CIRP is Not ...
The CIRP training emphasized a few things that it does not do.
CIRP does not cross over into mental health services. If needed, the peer can provide referrals to professionals.
CIRP does not perform accident investigations. If the affected pilot or engineer has information useful to an accident investigator, then they are encouraged to write it down and convey it to the investigation team.
CIRP is not a one-shot conversation. Peers commit to staying in communication with the affected person until the stress reaction is dealt with or they are referred to a professional.
CIRP avoids hierarchy and judgment. Peers do not mix management and pilots in the same group. This ensures that the peer support volunteer knows the job experiences and does not control the consequences of a stress reaction.
CIRP Training at Boeing in Seattle
With the suggestion by Terry Lutz and support of Erik Gundersen, I traveled to Seattle for a three-day CIRP training session held at Boeing.
The trainer was Captain Louise Cullinan from Mesa Airlines, who formerly was the CIRP chair for the ALPA union. Louise has been championing CIRP within the aviation community for about 15 years, helping to establish it with several other organizations. She has also participated in providing peer support services in numerous major accidents.
The impetus for Boeing?€?s CIRP effort was a significant incident during a test flight of the 787 Dreamliner 10 years ago. The test pilot, Van Chaney, had a delayed stress reaction that took several years to overcome. Van learned about CIRP and worked to bring it into the test community at Boeing. He realized that a more immediate CIRP interaction would have helped him. Boeing developed a CIRP team that includes peer groups of test pilots, test engineers and engineering analysts.
What I attended was a combination of initial certification (three days) and annual recurrent training (any one of the days). Initial certification of peer support volunteers involves learning about the program, its structure within aviation groups, stress reactions, grief reactions, listening skills and ways to interact with peers. The training also covers how to work in a one-on-one process, stress defusing group process and stress debriefing group process.
Role playing scenarios help demonstrate the challenges in listening, avoiding judgment and dealing with some of the more common stress reactions. Watching how new peers dealt with the clever twists played by recurrent peers was very impactful. This is not easy to do well.
Adapting the CIRP Structure to GA
One of my objectives for attending the training, beyond becoming certified in the CIRP processes, was to consider how this would apply to the COPA community. We are not a union, airline or manufacturer. We are mostly amateur pilots flying a Cirrus for recreation or business.
However, for CIRP to be effective, peers need to volunteer to support a community. They must undergo certification training and annual recurrent training. They need to practice keeping their skills effective.
Within airlines and manufacturers, many peers volunteer. Generally, they do not get paid for this service, although they may get time off to provide peer assistance. Many travel at their own expense, which is easier for airline pilots with jump-seat privileges.
Adapting these structures from professional organizations seems a bit challenging for the social and recreational COPA community.
COPA Opportunity
During a lunch break, I gave Van Chaney, who is now chief pilot for the Boeing 777, a copy of the safety issue of COPA Pilot magazine. He was immediately supportive and encouraging. After he had read Denean Richard?€?s article about healing from surviving a CAPS pull, Van became emphatic:
?€?She needs CIRP! COPA needs CIRP!?€?
We Need to Know Who is Interested
With the help of the Boeing team, Louise, Van, Terry, Erik, and several other CIRP participants who offered help, we have access to the guidance to adapt CIRP to our community.
We would like to know if you have experience with CIRP and would like to become involved with a similar program in COPA; do you have experience with peer support or want to learn how to be a good listener to help our peers in the community?
CIRP has resources in Europe, so we may be able to organize peer support volunteers around the world.
What You Can Do
If you have interest, please contact me at [email??protected]
You can also attend Migration 17 in New Orleans. There, you can expect to hear more about the Critical Incident Response Program and ways to support our members through peer support volunteers.
As Terry and Van both emphasized, our community needs this program and its resources.

The Focus on Loss of Control
Recently, there has been a lot of attention by many aviation groups focused on pilots losing control and causing fatal accidents. The NTSB has added loss of control to its Most Wanted List. The General Aviation Joint Steering Committee (GAJSC) published their recommendations. That?€?s where the Angle of Attack suggestion arose.
Loss of control describes what happened ?€? the pilot failed to maintain altitude, failed to maintain airspeed, etc. It does not, however, describe why it happened. Even worse, big buckets, like loss of control or maneuvering, often result in fallacious advice. Do not maneuver! Do not lose control! That really doesn?€?t work as a teaching or learning emphasis.
We need more fine-grain detail. What was the pilot doing? What factors led to something bad? Only then can we determine how to intervene, what safety program can address these factors, and what pilots can do to be safer.
Cirrus Aircraft Studied Loss of Control
At the Cirrus Training Partner Symposium held in mid-October 2015, Brad Miller presented a study about loss of control accidents in the Cirrus fleet. Brad has been an air safety investigator at Cirrus for over 10 years; he and his team have investigated many Cirrus accidents. He has also collaborated with COPA on providing helpful guidance to our safety efforts.
Brad maintains a database of all Cirrus events, accidents and incidents that come to their attention. For this study of loss of control accidents, he filtered a query on the following details:

NTSB investigation report of a Cirrus fatal accident
Probable cause issued
U.S. location

These are the most complete investigation reports of Cirrus accidents. They also will be easily accessible to instructors and pilots who have an interest in learning more details. With these accidents, Brad looked for loss of control (LOC) occurrence in the NTSB investigation. He excluded accidents that were not loss of control, including midair collisions, CFIT (controlled flight into terrain), and pilot incapacitation.
The resulting data set contained 56 fatal Cirrus accidents with a loss of control occurrence.
Analysis of Loss of Control Accidents
To break down the variety of accidents, each was placed in a bucket (see Figure 1).
The first breakdown was into rules of flight, either visual (VFR) or instrument (IFR). Then further broken down into the phase of flight when the loss of control happened. These included the standard phases: takeoff and departure, enroute, instrument approach, missed approach and landing phases. Because of the high frequency of loss of control during landing accidents, further breakdown helped with traffic pattern approach, final approach, flare/ runway contact/rollout, and go-arounds.
Figure 1: Buckets of Cirrus fatal accidents used to analyze the phase of flight where loss of control happened and what the pilot was doing.
Loss of Control by Flight Rules
The first breakdown into rules of flight (Figure 2)??suggests that both VFR and IFR flights involve loss of control. Slightly more than half of the accidents involve VFR flights.
Figure 2: Breakdown of 56 Cirrus fatal accidents into rules of flight: VFR (31) versus IFR (25).
If we wish to reduce Cirrus loss of control accidents, we will need to pay attention to both VFR and IFR flight.
VFR Flight Loss of Control
Analyzing the phases of flight for VFR loss of control accidents begins to shed some light on where things go badly (Figure 3). Many more VFR enroute and landing accidents happen than during takeoff.
Figure 3: Loss of control in VFR flight involves takeoff (2),??en route (14) and landing (15).
This suggests that we need to focus on aircraft control during visual flight enroute and landing.
IFR Flight Loss of Control
Breaking down the IFR loss of control accidents (Figure??4) shows a much different breakdown than VFR flight. As expected, instrument procedures become more involved, with more takeoff and departure accidents (7), along with instrument approach (6) and missed approach (1) accidents. Interestingly, IFR loss of control involves a smaller proportion of enroute accidents (8), yet there remain a few landing accidents (3).
Figure 4: Loss of control during IFR flight.
This suggests that we need to focus on proficiency with instrument flying to maintain control during instrument procedures.??
Takeoff and Departure Loss of Control

Figure 5: Takeoff and departure accidents.
VFR takeoff loss of control accidents (Figure 5) involve basic decisions:

No-flap takeoff while over gross (Greenwood, SC, 2004)
Return to airport maneuver during instructional flight, second attempt (Lancaster, CA, 2006)

IFR takeoff and departure loss of control accidents (Figure 5) involve two groups of factors:

Instrument interpretation and autopilot operation (Coconut Creek, FL, 2005; Stuart, FL, 2006; Indianapolis, IN, 2006; Mayfield Village, OH, 2009; Columbus, OH, 2011; Chesterfield, MO, 2013)
Inappropriate departure procedure (Front Royal, VA, 2008)

The VFR accidents suggest the need for better pre-flight planning to avoid return to airport maneuvers and ensure configuration for the performance required for takeoff and departure.
The IFR accidents suggest the importance of understanding your avionics, both the navigation and autopilot systems. Furthermore, pilots need to maintain situational awareness during abnormal situations, especially the need to consider CAPS.
Enroute Loss of Control
Loss of control during enroute flight (Figure 6) has more accidents (22) than any other phase of flight, even landing (18). Of course, the long duration of enroute flight phase creates more opportunities for problems to arise. Let?€?s review what situations COPA Pilots encountered.
Figure 6: Enroute loss of control.
The breakdown suggests factors that point to pilot discipline and aeronautical decision-making:

VFR into IMC (8) with poor weather evaluation, get-there-itis, pilot attitude and decision making (Hill City, MN, 2003; Arco, MN, 2005; Young, AZ, 2006; Agua Dulce, CA, 2010; Fredonia, AZ, 2011; West Liberty, OH, 2011; Crystal Lake, IL, 2011; Moscow, TN, 2012)
Icing (4) (Norden, CA, 2005; Maybell, CO, 2006; Meadview, AZ, 2006; Menomonie, WI, 2009)
Practice or instructional flights (2) that entered a spin (Parish, NY, 2002; Deltona, FL, 2009)
Horseplay or maneuvering (2) (Belgrade, MT, 2004; Manhattan, NY, 2006)
Fuel exhaustion (2) (Morton, WA, 2010; Carrollton, TX, 2011)
Aircraft performance exceeded (Paso Robles, CA, 2007)
Pilot incapacitation (Ravenswood, WV, 2009)
Collision with terrain (Danbury, CT, 2011)
Mechanical issue with electrical anomaly (Newcomerstown, OH, 2012)

These enroute loss of control accidents suggest the need for better aeronautical decision-making, especially for weather, pre-flight inspections and planning, as well as improved ability in handling abnormal situations.
Approach Loss of Control
The Cirrus fatal accidents in this bucket of instrument approach procedures (Figure 7) involved some basic instrument flying proficiency tasks:
Figure 7: Loss of control during IFR approach.

Off course heading (San Jose, CA, 2003; Willard, MO, 2012)
Off glideslope or glidepath (Huntersville, NC, 2006; New Windsor, NY, 2007)
Off both course heading and glideslope (Tallahassee, FL, 2008; Gary, IN, 2012)
Stalled while executing missed approach (Woodruff, WI, 2008)

These instrument procedure loss of control accidents suggest the need for improved proficiency during instrument flying.
Landing Loss of Control
Figure 8: Landing loss of control accidents.
We already know that landing accidents in the Cirrus fleet merits special attention and effort. The number of fatal landing accidents surprised me when Brad presented his analysis (Figure 8). Breaking down accidents into each of those landing buckets reveals some surprising details about what contributes to loss of control.
First, the traffic pattern accidents involve maneuvering low to the ground:

Bank angles and airspeed management:

??? Abrupt maneuvers (Rock Hill, NC, 2009; Melbourne, FL, 2012)
??? Base to final stalls (Waxhaw, NC, 2008; Deer Valley, Phoenix, AZ, 2010)
??? Slow airspeed (Lindsay, OK, 2008; Tuscaloosa, AL, 2010)
??? Busy traffic patterns (Tuscaloosa, AL, 2010; Scottsdale, Phoenix, AZ, 2011; Melbourne, FL, 2012)
??? Unknown (Scottsdale, Phoenix, AZ, 2011)


Simulated loss of engine power (Park Falls, WI, 2004)
Circling approach too low (Statesville, NC, 2006)

The only final-approach accident involved loss of control between 500 feet and the flare for landing:

Attempt to stretch a glide after reporting fumes in the cockpit and diverting (Moncks Corner, SC, 2009)

The single flare/rollout accident involved loss of control during the flare, runway contact and rollout phase:

Gusty winds affected landing sequence (Faribault, MN, 2007)

The biggest bucket of landing loss of control accidents in the Cirrus fleet occur during go-arounds:

Porpoising, bouncing, prop strikes (Fairfield, NJ, 2010; Chapel Hill, NC, 2010
Maintaining directional control (Crystal, MN, 2009, IFR; South Bend, IN, 2011, IFR)
Aggressive pitch and bank angles (Edgewater, MD, 2006; Anderson, SC, 2012)
Unknown, no data (Bolingbrook, IL, 2013)

These landing loss of control accidents suggest the need to address the sequence of maneuvers what we now call Approach-to-Landing-and-Go-Around. The flow of maneuvers needed to maintain control and situational awareness whenever something does not appear or go right.
As you may know, COPA and Cirrus Aircraft have collaborated on a Landing Standardization Course that addresses most of these aspects of landing loss of control accidents. COPA will be including this Landing Standardization syllabus during our recurrent flight training events.
Big Targets to Address Loss of Control
During Brad?€?s presentation to the Cirrus Training Partner Symposium, he compared the list of big targets from both his analysis and what COPA found. His big targets:

VFR into IMC
IFR takeoff
IFR approach
Landings and Go-Arounds??

He also noted the big targets from the previous COPA analysis of Cirrus accidents that led to the Command and Control course:

VFR into IMC
IFR departure procedures within two miles of the departure end of runway
IFR approach procedures between the initial approach fix and the runway

What You Can Do
First, you can reflect on your envelope of experience. When you read these analyses, ask yourself where do your tendencies fall into these buckets? Do you have sufficient weather knowledge? Do you assess risks of your flight while planning? Are you a little rusty with your crosswind landings or instrument procedures? Do you know of weaknesses in your flight proficiency, especially in tasks that show up in these loss of control accidents?
Second, seek out resources to help increase your proficiency. Obviously, COPA offers safety resources such as the preflight risk assessment seminar called Critical Decision Making (CDM). We also offer recurrent training through our  COPA Pilot Proficiency Program (CPPP). Cirrus training partners offer standardized transition, recurrent, and landing syllabi.
Third, talk with other COPA Pilots. Ask them what they do to ensure their safety. Encourage them to take advantage of these safety resources.
Most of all, know that we can all be safer pilots. Participate in our culture of safety, and enjoy flying your Cirrus.
For more information
Discussions of Cirrus accidents and safety issues are prominent on the COPA forums. Additional safety resources appear under the Safety tab.
Accident reports and information can be found on the NTSB website by searching for ?€?NTSB aviation database?€?. More detailed reports, photos and data can be found in the NTSB Document Management System website.
COPA publishes video materials on the YouTube channel copasafety. These include safety keynote talks from past Migrations, video animations that reconstruct accident flights, and occasional safety briefings.
You can also follow COPA safety events, resources, and dialogues on Twitter @copasafety.
Rick Beach joined COPA in 2001 and bought his Cirrus SR22 because of the community of owners and their focus on safety. He regularly posts online as the COPA de facto ?€?accident historian?€? and is the COPA Safety Chair. In his spare time, he works with educational non-profits to improve K-12 math and science education",4,5
7,Ways that Aviation Type Clubs can prepare and assist in accident investigations,Rick Beach,12/1/2015 18:52,,"Having participated in several annual meetings of the Type Club Coalition (TCC)??hosted by EAA, the thrust to enhance aviation safety routinely turns to involvement in accident investigations.
What to expect when type clubs become involved with accident investigations
?? ?€? accident investigations follow professional procedures
?? ?€? NTSB has responsibility for general aviation, but workload is very high, averaging 30 open investigations per investigator
?? ?€? FAA often begins the investigation because they have more local access
?? ?€? some investigations have known circumstances, usual from pilot statements, so they will have less depth
?? ?€? some investigations will involve close scrutiny, including NTSB R&D specialists as well as component specialists
?? ?€? expertise in a Type Club can help answer questions posed by the investigators, as well as suggest things to look for during the investigation
?? ?€? over time, building credibility and relationships will encourage deeper involvement (but lets all hope we don?€?t need to investigate more accidents in your type)
How to find out about accidents in your type of airplane
?? ?€? jungle drums often transmit info about accidents from local club members, instructors, airport managers, etc., so identifying a safety contact who remains connected to those who know about your aircraft type helps
?? ?€? many news reports contain aircraft identification, so a Google News Alert set for something like ?€?Cirrus crash?€? will send you email notifications (caution that many news reports misidentify the aircraft or use generic words like ?€?experimental?€? or ?€?light aircraft?€?, so it takes a bit of pruning to find the wheat in the chaff)
?? ?€? the FAA Preliminary Accident and Incident Report web page provides the most authoritative and timely reports of accidents (see the current reports here:??http://www.asias.faa.gov/pls/apex/f?p=100:93:0::NO:::)
?? ?€? the NTSB preliminary report will appear on the NTSB database within 10 business days for significant investigations, meaning that some investigations with known circumstances will not appear until the final report does
Who are the focal points in the FAA and NTSB
?? ?€? Tom took down the contact info here
NTSB Focal Points
?? ?€? Jeff suggested the type club find the regional office near the accident to determine the assigned investigator (see??https://www.ntsb.gov/about/contact.html)
?? ?€? note that investigators are assigned on a rotating basis, so your accident may be investigated by someone different than the investigator of the last accident of your type
Who are the focal points in the Type Clubs
?? ?€? at a minimum, we need an information contact
?? ?€? better would be to add a technical and/or safety contact
?? ?€? best would be to ensure that type clubs can update this information as it changes, perhaps by occasional prompts
Best practices for protocols to engage with accident investigations
?? ?€? people wanting to help with accident investigations need to come up the learning curve and meet the professionals at a higher level of understanding
?? ?€? researching prior investigation reports about accidents in your type of aircraft may help give you a better understanding of the ways you could help improve the reports
?? ?€? better if participants become familiar with the NTSB investigation process (see??https://www.ntsb.gov/investigations/process.html)
?? ?€? best if participants understand past efforts at safety improvements, especially the NTSB report on Safety of Experimental Amateur Built Aircraft (see??http://www.ntsb.gov/news/events/2012/EAB_Study/)
?? ?€? Jeff and I have been named as Parties to the Investigation, which is the gold standard for participation on the inside of the investigation and comes with several onerous obligations that people need to understand
?? ?€? Parties must sign a 14-page agreement the sets out your responsibilities and commitments, notably that all information about the investigation be kept confidential within the investigation team and any shared information must come from the NTSB Investigator in Charge
?? ?€? technical expertise may be useful for the investigation team, but that will likely originate from the team to the Type Club
?? ?€? timely and informative responses to questions from the investigator will build credibility
?? ?€? suggestions of what to look for or questions to research may be very helpful and begin to establish a relationship with the investigator, but respect that the investigator determines where the investigation goes
?? ?€? theories of what happened, or speculation about what happened, are less helpful early in the process when the focus is on gathering factual information, so be prudent about that kind of communication
Closing Thoughts
A closing thought: both the FAA and NSTB appreciate the potential for involving people with needed expertise. This may be design, engineering, construction, operation, or safety analysis expertise. However, the level of professionalism involved is high, so we need to do our part to meet them where they need the expertise.
A significant benefit of being helpful is the opportunity to guide the investigation and learn more that can help other pilots.

8,"In Last Six Months, Half the Fatal Accidents and Way More CAPS Saves",Rick Beach,12/8/2012 11:03,,"Compare the past six months
with the same time last year. You will see half the fatal accidents and way more CAPS saves.
What a difference a year
makes!
Last year, in the last six months of
2011, we saw 11 fatal accidents in Cirrus SR2X aircraft with only a single CAPS
save.* This year, in the same six months of 2012, we saw six fatal accidents and
four CAPS saves. (The other six months were a wash with no difference.) 
Last year, 22 people died and four seriously injured in those
fatal accidents, and this year only 12 died with two seriously injured. Last
year, one person survived a CAPS save, and this year nine people survived.
2012 had half the fatal
accidents, half the fatalities and a huge increase in CAPS saves and survivors.

Now, we understand that the decline in aviation accidents
may be affected by too many factors to draw any predictive conclusions. But it
feels good to see the big drop in the number of people who died in Cirrus
airplane accidents. And it truly amazes me that the number of CAPS saves
increased so dramatically.
Two interesting tidbits. In 2011, none of those pilots were COPA members, neither the pilots in fatal accidents or the lone CAPS pilot (who was trained in the military and also flies fighters).
An interesting tidbit about those 2012 CAPS saves: every one of those four CAPS pilots credit
COPA with preparing them to pull the red CAPS handle when faced with an
life-threatening emergency. Three were COPA members who had attended a CPPP
( COPA Pilot Proficiency Program), and one was a CSIP (Cirrus Standardized
Instructor Pilot) who spent his lunch watching the COPA M9 Safety Keynote
online that introduced ""0. CAPS .... CONSIDER"" for emergency procedures
When interviewed, they all said something like ""I just did what I trained to do.""
For reference, here are the four COPA forum threads about those four CAPS saves:
CAPS event #36
 in SR22 N138CK near Pickens, SC on 22 July 2012
CAPS event #37 in SR22 N80KW near Birmingham, AL on 6 Oct 2012
CAPS event #38 in SR22 N800RW near Show Low, AZ [16 Nov 2012]
CAPS event #39 in SR22 VH-WYH near Gilgandra, NSW, Australia [21 Nov 2012]

One poster put it as ""Once we figure out how to turn all fatals in to chute pulls, we still need to figure out how to stop the chute pulls.""
From reviewing all of the Cirrus fatal accidents and CAPS saves in 2014, here are some thoughts on how to accomplish those goals -- fewer fatal accidents and avoidable CAPS deployments.

Recent Fatal Accidents
We still have a few (very few, actually) fatal accidents. Just 2 in the US and 1 more in Brazil for 2014.
BAD WEATHER FLYING
The first in Brazil involved stormy weather over inhospitable jungle terrain (see Cirrus fatal #104 in SR22 PR-JHR near Mato Grasso, Brazil [19 Feb 2014] https://www.cirruspilots.org/copa/member/cirrus_general/cirrus_flying/f/4/t/139412.aspx)
No parachute activation in this one. Hence, we need to continue to work with all COPA Pilots to encourage them to plan for the use of CAPS and help them determine when they will use it.
PILOT INCAPACITATION
One was an incapacitation of the pilot at high altitude followed by an unsuccessful descent (See Cirrus fatal #105 in SR22T N930RH in Atlantic Ocean near Washington DC [30 August 2014] https://www.cirruspilots.org/copa/member/cirrus_general/cirrus_flying/f/4/t/144222.aspx)
Hence, we need to think about our health, our hypoxia symptoms, our oxygen delivery systems, and our use of avionics to get us down safely.
DESCENT THROUGH ICING CONDITIONS
Another was a very rapid and high-speed descent from on-top and through conditions conducive to icing (See Cirrus fatal #106 in SR22 N811CD near Findlay, OH [6 Nov 2014] https://www.cirruspilots.org/copa/member/cirrus_general/cirrus_flying/f/4/t/145189.aspx) We don't know much more than the loss of radar contact and an unusual debris field without a CAPS deployment. But we do know the weather forecasts and radar depictions, as well as concern for the pilot's determination to use CAPS.
Hence, we need to think about our weather knowledge, our pre-flight planning, our crew resource management when flying with another experienced pilot, our escape outs when flying near icing conditions, and our determination to use CAPS in situations where our outs don't work.
Recent CAPS Deployments
Turning our attention to chute pulls, we have a much happier outcome -- no one has died in 2014 after 12 CAPS saves with 23 survivors.
Yet, we still have numerous situations that command our attention. One area is loss of engine power. See the blog Reviewing the causes of loss of engine power in survivable CAPS saves (https://www.cirruspilots.org/copa/safety_programs/b/pull_early_pull_often/archive/2014/11/24/reviewing-the-causes-of-loss-of-engine-power-in-survivable-caps-saves.aspx)
Those causes break down into several areas that we can address.
MAINTENANCE INDUCED FAILURES (MIF)
While we don't maintain the engine ourselves, we do select the shop where the maintenance gets done. Choose wisely. Confirm that work performed is inspected as required. Assess if the workplace and the workload are well organized, such that few distractions interrupt critical tasks.
Mike Busch has written extensively about maintenance failures. A couple of his articles in COPA Pilot and his book, Manifesto, tell the stories of MIF.
FUEL MISMANAGEMENT
Flying without fuel is tough to do. You don't get very far. So, preflight procedures need to ensure that you have planned for sufficient fuel for all contingencies and diversions, as well as having on board the fuel you expected.
FUEL STARVATION
Harder to explain are the few accidents where the plane landed with fuel in the tanks, just not getting to the engine. Task saturation and task fixation can overwhelm us. Switching fuel tanks would have kept the fuel flowing. But are we prepared to follow a checklist in an emergency? Or to remember to find the checklist?
DETONATION or PRE-IGNITION
If you see the cylinder temps rising quickly, then you only have a brief time, perhaps less than a minute, to do something to address the cause. You do watch the CHT display, right? You do have alarms that tell you when CHT has exceeded a threshold of safety, right?
Two key actions: one is to cool the cylinder and the other is prepare to abandon flight. See the interview with Tom Brooks Glass shown at M12 about his engine failure. See http://youtu.be/YgOKRe7Bb2M

OIL QUANTITY and OIL PRESSURE
As some have noted, the Cirrus IO-550N engine configuration uses a rather small sump with about 8 quarts capacity. Lose oil and your engine will fail.
One investigation found that flying with the oil dipstick not fully inserted and clamped shut can cause oil to leave the engine, causing loss of oil pressure and ultimate catastrophic engine failure.
Another investigation found that high oil consumption can leave your engine with insufficient oil quantity. Several engine overhauls have dealt with stuck oil-control rings. When your engine starts blowing lots of oil overboard, you have only a few good options.
Fly with your own oil supply in a case in the baggage compartment. Depart with a full oil sump, especially on long legs. Use the ring flush technique to attempt to unstick the stuck oil-control rings. Consider a top overhaul (carefully due to MIF reasons above) to perform a ring and valve job.
GO-AROUND POWER LOSS
A suspicion about a couple of scenarios involves the engine failing to make the power demanded. When you need to go-around, you need power. To get power, you need fuel-air-spark in sufficient quantities to make max power.
Review your go-around procedure. Do you have the boost pump on? Best to avoid vapor lock; best to avoid insufficient fuel quantity; best to indicate that you are cleared to land (a habit i formed a long time ago).
Do you advance the throttle and the mixture together? If you operated LOP or even ROP, you may not have sufficient fuel flow into the engine for max power. With an SR20 or turbo, max power comes from full rich mixture. With an NA SR22, max power comes from the fuel flow on the placard by altitude. My personal technique in my NA SR22 is to advance both throttle and mixture fully forward then lean the mixture to the placard fuel flow (this needs you to brief the density altitude for the landing approach, since you will need that info to adjust the mixture).
FATIGUE FAILURES of ENGINE COMPONENTS
Okay, finally, we reach a set of causes that we can't do much about. The failure of an internal engine component, such as a piston skirt, a connecting rod, a crankshaft. Whenever a systemic failure is discovered, such as the episode of spalled lifters, there are vigorous discussions among the many affected parties. However, recent examples are so idosyncratic that we don't have any good ways to prevent failures.
EMERGENCY PROCEDURES
Finally, we need to ensure that when something bad happens, we have prepared ourselves to follow memorized emergency procedures. See Top 10 Emergency Memory Items (https://www.cirruspilots.org/copa/non_member/marketplace/b/tips_from_csips/archive/2012/09/14/top-10-emergency-memory-items.aspx)
Summary
The COPA Culture of Safety illustrates how COPA members succeed with these actions. COPA discussions of accidents include many exhortations to do these things. Participants at our?? COPA Pilot Proficiency Program (CPPP) regularly comment on the valuable impact of those ground courses and recurrent flight training segments. Participants at our Critical Decision Making (CDM) seminars experience the value and intensity of pre-flight planning to address risks we undertake on every flight. And the results are trending in the best direction -- fewer fatal accidents and fewer fatalities. (See the summary CAPS Saves and Fatal Accidents and then review the Cirrus Accident Rates discussion.

10,Reviewing the causes of loss of engine power in survivable CAPS saves,Rick Beach,11/24/2014 19:47,,"(updated with additional Probable Cause determinations by the NTSB; 2 July 2017)
Several recent conversations have highlighted the number of survivable CAPS deployments that involved loss of engine power scenarios. To help place these scenarios in context, here is a summary of the CAPS saves that involved loss of engine power since 1999 when the SR20 was introduced. Several of the more recent investigations have not yet published reasons for the loss of engine power and are noted as ""cause TBD.""
An important point to make about these investigations -- pilots chose to deploy CAPS rather than attempt a risky off-airport landing. Everyone on board these Cirrus aircraft survived. The same cannot be said about several COPA Pilots who did not deploy CAPS and died during an off-airport landing. And for other general aviation makes/models of aircraft, fatal off-airport landings are all too frequent despite the overwhelming success rate. In a Cirrus, the risks of a fatal outcome are not worth it. Pull early, pull often!
Note that engine problems that did not result in a CAPS deployment are not included in this review; that work is for someone else at another time.

11,Safety Good News presentation at COPA Dinner @ Oshkosh 2014,Rick Beach,8/21/2014 20:49,,"During the COPA dinner at Oshkosh 2014, a brief safety talk highlighted the good news for COPA Pilots. All of the categories of accidents in Cirrus aircraft have gone down.
Here's an annotated version of that talk.

Sources: COPA compilation of Cirrus fatal accidents world-wide, confirmed with Air Safety team at Cirrus Aircraft; Estimate from Reliability Engineering at Cirrus Aircraft of 950,000 flying hours in 12 months for the fleet of 5,700 production aircraft based on Hobbs meter readings at warranty, service bulletins and parachute repacks.
At the time of the talk, July 30, 2014, there had been 4 fatal accidents in the past 365 days or 12 months (Chesterfield/St. Louis, MO; Bolingbroke, IL; Freeport, Bahamas; Mato Grasso, Brazil missing and presumed fatal). Consequently, the fatal accident rate was 0.42 Cirrus fatal accidents per 100,000 hours of flying time.??
As of posting this blog, the rate has dropped further to 3 fatal Cirrus accidents in 12 months. The fatal accident rate is now 0.32.??
There has not been a fatal accident in the US for eleven months, since September 25 (Bolingbroke, IL).
How does this compare to GA?

Sources: NTSB presentation at GA Safety Forum, June 2012; Cirrus accidents from NTSB accident database, searching for all investigations, Make = Cirrus, Category = Airplane, Amateur = No; Flying hours estimates from Reliability Engineering at Cirrus Aircraft
The NTSB publishes accident rates for all of General Aviation. This chart, presented in June 2012, shows that the all accident rate for all of GA has remained steady for a decade. What made national news was the realization that breaking down the accident rate by purpose of flying revealed an increase of 20 percent over the past 10 years when flying for personal reasons. Since most of the Cirrus fleet are not heavily involved in commercial, instructional or flying for business purposes, that increase in personal flying contrasts with the declining rate of Cirrus accidents -- all accidents, including fatal accidents, non-fatal accidents, incidents and CAPS saves.

Plotting the NTSB accident rates for all GA rate (thin green line) and the personal flying rate (thick green line, comparable with most of Cirrus flying activity), we can compare the one-year and three-year rates of Cirrus fatal accidents (blue and red lines respectively).
The Cirrus fleet is about 1/30 of the single-engine piston fleet registered in the US (5000 aircraft vs 150,000 aircraft) and increasing by 250 to 300 airplanes each year. Yet the rates are falling ?€? a lot.
What about other types of investigations ?€? non-fatal accidents and CAPS Saves?
NTSB investigations of all Cirrus accidents

Sources: NTSB aviation database with three queries for Accident + Fatal, Accident + Non-Fatal, Incident, then extracting investigations of known CAPS deployments, which might be either an accident or incident.
The NTSB accident database contains all of the investigations conducted by the NTSB, about 1500 each year. Most, but not all, Cirrus accidents are investigated by the NTSB, since some accidents in foreign locations of planes registered in foreign countries are investigated solely by those civil aviation agencies.
As of July 30, the NTSB database for 2014 shows zero incidents, zero fatal accidents, and only four non-fatal accidents, a major and significant decline. In contrast, the number of CAPS saves continues to increase over time. Interestingly, in 2014 year-to-date, an additional four CAPS saves occurred in foreign countries, but this is the NTSB data.
Trends in CAPS saves versus fatal accidents

Sources: COPA compilation of world-wide Cirrus fatal accidents and CAPS deployments with survivors, confirmed with Air Safety team at Cirrus Aircraft. Note: the NTSB database omits about 11 fatal Cirrus accidents in other countries (93 of 104), as well as some known survivable CAPS deployments.
This is a really good news slide. In 2014, year-to-date, only 1 fatal Cirrus accident worldwide. 2011 was a horrible year, with 16 fatal accidents, including 8 in just three months, even 3 in a 24-hour period. Of those 8 fatal accidents in the fall of 2011, five were in rental aircraft, flying clubs, or used aircraft without transition training for the pilots.??
The trend of CAPS saves has continued to increase, while the 2014 count of fatal accidents dropped to just 1 in the first 7 months of the year.
Looking at fatalities

Sources: COPA compilation of known fatal Cirrus accidents world-wide, confirmed with Air Safety team at Cirrus Aircraft
The best news comes from realizing that only one person has died while flying in a Cirrus aircraft in the first seven months of 2014.
From that horrible year in 2011, several initiatives came together to change the culture of safety in the Cirrus community. So, in 2014, we count only one fatality, which is the pilot in Brazil who was lost in the rain forest and presumed dead.
Those initiatives include

reforming pilot training presented at the SAFE Symposium in May 2011,
the CAPS Consider keynote talk in July 2011,
the focus on training pilots about the CAPS system at October 2011, and then
the worldwide news interest in Dr. Dick McGlaughlin?€?s parachute save in the Bahamas in January 2012.
Those efforts aligned multiple agents towards a common message that training to use the parachute recovery system would save lives ?€? COPA members, Cirrus Aircraft training staff, Cirrus standardized instructors, and the general public.

And it?€?s not just the parachute. It?€?s the high expectations we now have for COPA Pilots to fly safely.
We are not done yet. One pilot at a time. You can make the difference.

12,Mid-Year 2014 Update on Improved Cirrus accident rates,Rick Beach,7/1/2014 17:02,"Fatalities in Cirrus AccidentsFatal Cirrus Accidents versus CAPS SavesFrequency of Cirrus Fatal Accidents and CAPS SavesFatal Cirrus Accident Rates Per 100,000 Hours Flying Time","Since the beginning of 2014, Cirrus accident rates show a dramatic and welcome reduction.
Fatalities in Cirrus Accidents
Most importantly, fewer people have died in Cirrus accidents.
Here's the number of fatalities by year since introduction of the Cirrus SR20 in 1999 and the first fatal accident in 2001. (Note: data for these charts comes from COPA and Cirrus Aircraft and includes accidents??world-wide.)
??
We are halfway through the year 2014 with only one presumed fatality worldwide. (That fatality is presumed to have happened in Brazil where the plane went missing in February and has not been found since.)
The Cirrus fleet has continued to increase to over 5,700 aircraft produced. The fleet hours are estimated to have increased to almost 6.5 million hours with about a million hours in the last 12-month period.
People are still flying in Cirrus aircraft, but fewer people died this year.
Fatal Cirrus Accidents versus CAPS Saves
One reason for fewer fatalities comes from increased use of the Cirrus airframe parachute (CAPS). That is, the number of CAPS deployments with survivors has increased over the past six years while the number of fatal accidents has declined since the worst year in 2011. (Interesting to realize that most of the 2011 fatal accidents were in aircraft purchased used or flown from rental or flying clubs.)

Almost all of those CAPS saves in 2014 involved mechanical issues with loss of engine power. One involved an icing encounter and another a loss of control during a demonstration flight. The use of CAPS avoided a risky off-airport landing in those situations.
Frequency of Cirrus Fatal Accidents and CAPS Saves
When the frequency of Cirrus fatals and CAPS saves are charted by quarter, the decline in fatal accidents can be seen more clearly from the worst 3-month period in the fall of 2011.??

Nice to see zero fatal accidents (red) in 2014Q2, something that has not happened since 2006Q2 when the fleet was only 2,700 aircraft produced, less than half of the current fleet size. Also good to see that COPA members (yellow) are less and less involved in fatal accidents over time, with the last one in 2013Q3.
That prompts a chart that superimposes the growth of the Cirrus fleet size (GAMA data) and flying hours (Cirrus Aircraft data) with the accident frequency (COPA data):

While the fleet and flight activity continue to grow, the fatal accident frequency shows a declining trend, with CAPS saves keeping people from serious or fatal injuries in bad situations.
Fatal Cirrus Accident Rates Per 100,000 Hours Flying Time
By tracking the world-wide fatal accidents and utilizing the estimated fleet flying hours from Cirrus Aircraft, we can chart the Cirrus accident rate and compare to the NTSB general aviation rates.

The two NTSB rates come from their analysis of general aviation activity. The lower rate (thin green), hovering around 1.2 fatal accidents per 100,000 flying hours includes all types of general aviation activities, especially those with excellent safety history such as corporate and instructional flying. The higher rate (thick green), increasing to 2.38 fatal accidents per 100,000 flying hours separates out flying for personal purposes, which would match the majority of Cirrus flight activity.
Because the Cirrus fleet is less than 1/30 of the single-engine piston fixed-wing fleet in GA, two moving averages are plotted for the Cirrus accident rates, one for a 12-month period (blue) and another smoothing out the effects of a small fleet using a 36-month period (red). An obvious impediment to those trends was the horrific 2011Q4 period when 8 Cirrus fatal accidents happened in 3 months, with 3 accidents in just 24 hours.
Yet, the overall trend since 2007 has shown improvement with fewer accidents over increased flying hours. And the most recent few quarter years show even greater decline.
Good news to report. Of course, these trends are the compilation of thousands of individual pilots flying individual aircraft on numerous flights. Continued diligence will be required.

13,On CAPS deployments that landed in water -- about those landing gear!,Rick Beach,6/18/2014 20:52,,"Recently, a forum discussion on BeechTalk posited concerns about landing in water under the Cirrus parachute system (CAPS). Since the landing gear would not touch firm ground, the concern arose about the higher impact energy for occupants. Fortunately, other design features have ensured survivable outcomes in all of the CAPS deployments over water, such as the 3-inch honeycomb aluminum seat pans for the front occupants, the crush zone under the rear seats, the side yoke to avoid impalement injuries, the flat instrument panel with padded glareshield.
From accident investigation reports, we have seen six CAPS deployments that resulted in water landings:
Haverstraw, NY (Hudson River) 2005 -- pilot blacked out due to a brain tumor, woke up in a Vne dive, recovered, but realized his leg was compromised so he deployed CAPS and landed in the river. He described water splashing up to the top of the cockpit windows, so fuselage moved water out of the way. He suffered fractures of his lower back. Likely he was not properly positioned with seat back upright and pressed against the seat. Pilot was snowboarding 6 months later and flew with instructors until his brain tumor returned and he quit flying.
Patterson, LA 2008??-- pilot lost engine power (probably fuel exhaustion, but no investigation was conducted). Plane landed in a bayou and was recovered on an air boat, repaired and flew again. No injuries.
Hamilton Island, Australia 2009 -- pilot reported partial engine power, attempted to return to airport when he could not climb above 600'. Pilot froze when the engine finally seized and pulled at 441' MSL (from data). Plane entered the water nose low and pilot was injured due to his unorthodox brace position when he grabbed the handles on the cockpit roof and tore several shoulder muscles. Pilot broke out of the rear seat window (he was big, 6'4"" and probably 240 pounds), surfaced, and was rescued. He was hospitalized with soft tissue injuries, recovered and continued selling??Cirrus??aircraft.
New Orleans, LA 2011??-- pilot reported catastrophic engine failure during IMC departure. Attempted return to airport but deployed 4 miles short of runway and landed in Lake Ponchartrain. Pilot remained on empennage in the fog until found by fishermen about 45 minutes later. No injury.
Andros Island, Bahamas 2012??-- pilot deployed due to catastrophic engine failure on his monthly trip to Haiti. Plane landed in ocean. Pilot reported hard impact, but both occupants were uninjured and managed to enter their life raft. Pilot bought a replacement within 5 weeks and was flying to Haiti soon after.
La Guajira, Colombia 2013 -- midair collision broke tail off airplane, so pilot deployed CAPS immediately. Plane landed in ocean with no injuries.
There actually was a seventh CAPS deployment that landed on water . . .
Alexander, MN 2013 -- pilot attempted to manhandle a broken flap actuator but could not turn left, resulting in an unusual attitude low to the ground and pulled CAPS -- another CAPS deployment landed on a lake -- frozen! No fear. The landing gear are not needed to absorb energy when landing in water -- or trees, or powerlines, or swamps, or mountain slopes, or orchards.??CheersRick",0,0
14,On injuries from surviving a CAPS pull,Rick Beach,6/18/2014 21:33,,"Recently, a private conversation with a COPA member sought information about injuries in CAPS pulls. He had heard that people suffered a lot of back injuries due to landing under parachute. That didn't match with my recollection, so that prompted me to review all of the injuries among the 46 survivable CAPS deployments. Here's the complete list:
- lower back compression fracture at Haverstaw, NY in 2005 (1 hospitalized, Ilan Reich?€?s CAPS save), where pilot had to break open the window with the egress hammer, go back in to retrieve his life vest, begin swimming to shore when first responders picked him up, then hospital informed him that he had a back fracture along with a brain tumor that had caused his blackout. Pilot walked out of the hospital the next day and was snowboarding six months later*
- lower back injuries at Indianapolis, IN in 2006, where passenger pulled 528?€? AGL in a 100 knot spin just 4 seconds prior to impact, which was too low to fully deploy the chute (1 fatality, 3 hospitalized)
- lower back injuries at Siassconset, MA in 2007, where parachute snagged on communications tower and plane dropped (2 serious injuries, although the pregnant passenger gave birth to normal child)
- fractured ankle at Turricao, Italy in 2008, where rudder pedal cracked heel bone (1 fracture, 3 uninjured)
- strained shoulder muscles and cuts at Hamilton Island, Australia in 2009, where pilot used unorthodox and unapproved restraint by grabbing handles above cockpit doors (1 hospitalization)
- cut on forehead requiring stitches at Birmingham, AL in 2012, where passenger bumped her head
Otherwise, no injuries or only minor cuts and bruises for the other 86 people who survived a parachute landing.
So, are there a lot of back injuries ?€? no. There are some, just six from the earliest CAPS deployments. But an overwhelming number of uninjured survivors.
Perhaps better awareness of the brace position, with your back pressed firmly against the seat back, has helped. Certainly, very few injuries since 2007 after CAPS save #11!!!

15,Cirrus accident history continues improvement through first quarter of 2014,Rick Beach,4/1/2014 20:44,Cirrus Fatal AccidentsFatalities in Cirrus Fatal AccidentsTrend in All Cirrus Accidents,"The Cirrus Owners and Pilots Association (COPA) maintains a focus on safety throughout our programs and activities. Consequently, we also focus on tracking the results and outcomes from accident investigations. Over the past several years, the decline in fatal accidents exceeds the slight decline in all of General Aviation in the US. The increased use of the Cirrus Airframe Parachute System (CAPS) appears to have dramatically reduced the number of fatalities. And overall, we have seen a counter trend to the increased number of aircraft produced with a steady to slight decline in the number of total accidents, including fatals, parachute saves, non-fatals, and incidents.
Cirrus Fatal Accidents
First, number of fatal accidents per year has gone down over the past 3-5 years.??

Discount the 2014 number of fatal accidents, since that's the winter months during severe weather.??
However, you can see an Interesting declining trend since the peak in 2009. The anomaly in the fall of 2011 represents 8 accidents in 3 months, mostly in rental, used or flying club aircraft.
The green bars show a counter trend in CAPS parachute saves, in which increasingly COPA Pilots are deploying the parachute rather than risk an off-airport landing. The 5 CAPS saves in the first 3 months of 2014 does seem like a significant change, especially given the severe weather during that time period.
Fatalities in Cirrus Fatal Accidents
While fatal accidents have trended down, the number of fatalities per year seems to have really fallen farther.

Again, discount 2014Q1 due to severe weather in the winter months. But the lower 2013 number of fatalities suggests that our safety efforts may have had good effect.??We believe that this greater reduction in fatalities is largely due to the increased use of CAPS to survive off-airport landings.
Trend in All Cirrus Accidents
While saving lives remains an important measure of safety, COPA members also show interest in reducing any accident. Here are the number of NTSB accident/incident reports in their database since the introduction of the SR20 in mid-1999.

Note that the NTSB database shows fewer fatal accidents and CAPS saves than COPA numbers above. COPA data includes any Cirrus event from around the world. The NTSB only records those for which it has been involved in the investigation.
While the reduction in total accidents remains a work in progress, recall that the number of Cirrus aircraft flying has increased from about 3,000 at the start of 2007 and is now over 5,600 at the start of 2014. That's an increase of 86% in aircraft flying while we've seen a drop of about 10% in all accidents.??
Feels good to be on the right side of these trends.

16,About Maneuvering in Fatal Cirrus Accidents,Rick Beach,3/31/2014 19:08,NTSB data on maneuvering in fatal accidentsMore on maneuvering phase of flight VFR in IMC or loss of control in IMCPractice maneuversFuel exhaustionLow-level maneuvers Lessons from maneuvering in Cirrus fatal accidents,"As COPA members may know from frequenting the COPA discussion forums, we have several members who believe that eliminating maneuvering accidents will greatly reduce the accident rate.
Often, these beliefs are posted during discussions of egregious violations of safe flight procedures, such as unauthorized aerobatics or buzzing.
The claim states that maneuvering appears as a large percentage of fatal accidents. Furthermore, they posit that maneuvering accidents are intentional acts. So, the posters seem to believe that pilots can eliminate low-level maneuvering and that would reduce the accident rate ?€? a lot!
I?€?ve always wondered about that.
How many such maneuvering accidents happen? And what changes would make the greatest impact on reducing accidents?
Since reducing the accident rate is something that we all can agree needs attention, eventually, I got around to looking more closely at the data.
NTSB data on maneuvering in fatal accidents
When the NTSB??published??their??Review of U.S. Civil Aviation Accidents, Calendar Year 2010,??(PDF, 73 pages), they included this chart as Figure 34, Phase of flight for personal flying accidents, 2010.

Note that the largest number of fatal accidents, 57 out of 190 or 30%, occurred during Maneuvering phase. Obviously, if we could make a significant dent by reducing those Maneuvering accidents, then surely the fatal accident rate would go down.
Cirrus fatal accidents involving maneuvering
Then I took a closer look at all of the Cirrus accidents that were listed in the NTSB database of aviation accidents since the SR20 went into production in mid-1999. Searching for all accidents in Cirrus aircraft (Make = Cirrus, Category = Airplane, Amateur Built = No) involving maneuvering (Broad Phase of Flight = Maneuvering) yielded 23 records.
Wow, 23 Cirrus accidents involved maneuvering! That is a bunch and certainly looks like a productive area for reducing accidents.
Upon closer examination, those 23 also include 5 non-fatal accidents and 1 pre-production accident. So, if 17 fatal accidents involving maneuvering could be avoided among the 90 fatal Cirrus accidents in the NTSB database, then we would see about 20% fewer fatal Cirrus accidents. That seemed worth pursuing.
What happened in those 17 fatal Cirrus accidents?
Here is my brief narrative of each fatal Cirrus accident that was classified by the NTSB as involving maneuvering flight.

Parish, NY, 2002Double fatality due to a spin while practicing stalls using aggressive maneuvers by two pilots with low time-in-type
Las Vegas, NM, 2002Fatal CFIT while attempting to reverse course in VFR-in-IMC conditions
Hill City, MN, 2003Fatal loss of control while attempting to reverse course in VFR-in-IMC conditions
Belgrade, MT, 2004Fatal CFIT due to a stall during photo mission tracking a slow motor glider over a ridge
Coconut Creek, FL, 2005Fatal loss of control in IMC due to spatial disorientation, avionics confusion, and operational confusion
Lancaster, CA, 2006Fatal loss of control while attempting return to airport procedure during primary flight instruction for private pilot with a CFI
Stuart, FL, 2006Fatal loss of control while attempting to reverse course after reporting avionics problems, perhaps due to pitot/static issues
Manhattan, NY, 2006Fatal loss of control while attempting a box-canyon turn over the East River and overflying high-rise buildings with a CFI in the right seat
Statesville, NC, 2006Fatal loss of control during go-around after missed approach
Paso Robles, CA, 2007Fatal loss of control after abrupt climb to avoid terrain in mountain wave wind conditions
Lindsay, OK, 2008Fatal loss of control attempting to correct for overshooting final approach course during practice power-off landing with CFI who had zero time in a Cirrus
Deltona, FL, 2009Fatal spin while practicing slow flight and stalls with a CFI
Rock Hill, SC, 2009Fatal CFIT while attempting return to airport procedure for unknown reasons
Agua Dulce, CA , 2010Fatal loss of control while attempting to reverse course in VFR-in-IMC conditions
Fredonia, AZ, 2011Fatal CFIT during attempt to change course in night VMC conditions
Carrollton, TX, 2011Fatal loss of control during second missed approach involving fuel exhaustion
Duck Creek Village, UT, 2012Fatal CFIT while attempting to out-climb terrain at high density altitude in SR20

Oddly, the Boynton Beach, FL, fatal Cirrus accident in 2001 that involved unauthorized aileron-roll aerobatics was not coded with any phase of flight in the NTSB database.
More on maneuvering phase of flight
However, when I review those 17 accidents for maneuvering, I find other factors that seem to dominate rather than intentional acts.
A quick web search for ""NTSB maneuvering phase of flight"" produced an AOPA Air Safety Institute article??Watch this!??That article also exhorts pilots to avoid intentional low-level maneuvers:
""Low-level maneuvering was the leading fatal phase of flight again this year as it has been for the last five, holding steady at about 20 percent,"" wrote ASF Executive Director Bruce Landsberg. ""In the vast majority of cases, the accelerated stall, impact with wires, a building, or an object, should not be considered a surprise.""
??20% from the AOPA? 30% from the NTSB? 20% in Cirrus fatal accidents?
Yet, those maneuvering Cirrus accidents listed above seem to involve these several factors other than intentional low-level maneuvering.
VFR in IMC or loss of control in IMC
7 of the 18 fatal Cirrus accidents involved maneuvering while in instrument conditions. Some were VFR-in-IMC scenarios:??Las Vegas, NM;??Hill City, MN; Auga Dulce, CA;??Fredonia, AZ. Some were IFR flights:??Coconut Creek, FL;??Stuart, FL;??Statesville, NC.
Note that the Cirrus community has experienced more loss of control in IMC accidents than these; these were the only ones with maneuvering coded as the phase of flight.
Practice maneuvers
Another 5 of 18 accidents happened while practicing flight maneuvers:??Parish, NY ?€? stalls without instructor; Lancaster, CA* -- second attempt of return to airport with low-time CFI;??Lindsay, OK* -- simulated power-off landing with zero time CFI;??Deltona, FL* -- stalls with instructor;??Rock Hill, SC ?€? return to airport solo.
* Note three of those five accidents had a??CFI in the right seat conducting an instructional flight.
Fuel exhaustion
One accident involved fuel exhaustion during a missed approach:??Carrollton, TX
Low-level maneuvers
After removing all of those accidents from consideration, we are left with only 4 that involved low-altitude maneuvers:

Belgrade, MT, 2004Fatal CFIT due to a stall during photo mission tracking a slow motor glider over a ridge



Manhattan, NY, 2006Fatal loss of control while attempting a box-canyon turn over the East River and overflying high-rise buildings with a CFI in the right seat



Paso Robles, CA, 2007Fatal loss of control after abrupt climb to avoid terrain in mountain wave wind conditions



Duck Creek Village, UT, 2012Fatal CFIT while attempting to out-climb terrain at high density altitude in SR20


That smaller set of low-level maneuvering accidents results in a much smaller percentage of Cirrus fatal accidents, just 4 of 90 or less than 5%. That better comports with my expectation that the phase the NTSB calls maneuvering includes much more than intentional low-level buzzing or impacting trees, wires or buildings.
Lessons from maneuvering in Cirrus fatal accidents
So, what changes would make the greatest impact on reducing the fatal accident rate?
Here is my list of take away lessons to reduce the fatal accidents involving maneuvering:

Improve in-flight discipline when flying in IMC (a factor in 7 of 18 fatal Cirrus accidents)
Practice procedures with Cirrus knowledgeable instructors (a factor in 5 of 18)

From this analysis, I conclude that the Cirrus community does not have a large proportion of intentional maneuvering accidents. Only 4 of 90 fatal accidents involved low-level maneuvers.
However, the Cirrus community does have a history of poor airmanship and poor judgment.????Better training would help here.
We are not done yet.

17,Cirrus fatal accidents drop more than GA or Amateur Built,Rick Beach,10/20/2013 21:09,,"A story from EAA,??Experimental Fatal Accidents Fall Dramatically in 2013, prompted me to analyze the difference in general aviation in general and Cirrus models in particular.
The key numbers in the EAA article are a 25% drop in fatal accidents in experimental aircraft from FY2012 to FY2013, time periods that correspond to the FAA and NTSB fiscal year from October 1 to September 30. They note that included in that are a 30% drop in amateur built experimental aircraft in the same time period.
Good progress, eh?! ??Well done, EAA members and the experimental aircraft community.
Now I was curious if there was a similar drop in GA or Cirrus fatal accident rates.
Of course, we have documented a substantial drop in Cirrus fatal accidents in the past year, so I was initially fascinated and concerned that maybe our improvement was nothing more than good vibes throughout general aviation.
I shouldn't have worried. What an interesting comparison.
Using the NTSB database, you can't easily filter for experimental aircraft, but you can filter for amateur built aircraft and make/model of Cirrus aircraft. When I checked, some of the NTSB investigations have miscoded aircraft without the amateur built category. Consequently, I trust the EAA analysis. But my numbers don't seem to be too far off from the EAA analysis.
Here's what I found:

fatal accidents in all of general aviation dropped 14% from 221 to 189 between FY2012 and FY2013
amateur built fatal accidents (as coded by the NTSB investigators) dropped 35% from 48 to 31
Cirrus fatal accidents (as included in the NTSB database) dropped 69% from 16 to 5
Cirrus fatal accidents (as recorded by COPA and Cirrus Aircraft) dropped 59% from 17 to 7

Note that the Cirrus accidents in the NTSB database omit one from FY2012 (Tiros, Brazil) and two from FY2013 (South Africa and the most recent accident in Bolingbroke, IL).??
In pictures* . . .


What does this mean to you?
Clearly, the amateur built category was subject to a massive communication blitz about improving their safety record. The NTSB did a special study. EAA increased coverage of safety initiatives in their magazine. EAA also championed changes in the way flight testing was conducted. A focus on safety seemed to help them.
And in the Cirrus community, more than a 50% drop in fatal accidents is pretty amazing, eh?! 
IMHO, this is the culmination of several factors at once -- Cirrus Aircraft increasing focus on safety instruction with CSIP and Cirrus Training Centers, COPA initiatives like Consider CAPS and revitalizing our safety initiatives for CPPP and CDM, as well as public media attention to parachute saves -- oh, it works!
Now the challenge is to see if these amazing results persist over time . . .

18,"Another exposition on the mantra Pull Early, Pull Often",Rick Beach,8/14/2013 17:46,,"In December of 2005, the first post with the phrase Pull Early and Often appeared. It was immediately controversial. And misunderstood. Too often, the claim was made that it meant pull the CAPS parachute handle without considering other recovery options. In retrospect, COPA Pilots have understood it to mean more -- to pull early in the bad situation before you get too fast or fly too low and to pull in more situations than commonly understood. Recently, another reference to the dislike of this phrase prompted another exposition on the importance to COPA Pilots that they think differently about when they will use CAPS.
The dislike of the mantra ""Pull Early, Pull Often"" has been oft repeated. However, the interpretation of the meaning and impact does not require an either/or thought process. It can be both planning outs and pulling early. Many other COPA members take away from this mantra the need to plan differently when you are flying a Cirrus with a parachute recovery system.
Most take ""Pull Early"" to mean pull before you get too fast or get too low -- when other planned outs or recoveries will not reduce the risk of a crash. It becomes a threshold decision criteria. In military terms, it is their hard-deck altitude below which you will not descend without ejecting, or in our case deploying CAPS.
When faced with a bad situation, there are several issues to consider. I propose these be considered in order because of the consequences of inaction. Note that they all require some awareness of your height above ground, which may be a challenge in the heat of an emergency.
Foremost, do you have control? If not, do you have sufficient altitude and skill to attempt recovery???If you do not have control and unable to recover, then PULL CAPS!
If you do not have control but do have altitude and skill, then attempt recovery, but maintain awareness of your hard-deck altitude above the ground. If not, then PULL CAPS!
If you have control but are below your hard-deck altitude, then execute a forced landing. Sorry, but CAPS needs about 8 seconds and 500-600 feet minimum to fully deploy.
If you have control and sufficient altitude, then what height above ground will be your hard-deck altitude to pull early?
Cirrus recommends 2,000 feet AGL. We know that CAPS has worked down to 386 feet AGL in level flight just above the stall speed. But we also know that way too many COPA Pilots have deployed CAPS below 200 feet and perished. They didn't pull early enough. They died.
Examples of too-low CAPS deployments with fatalities:
??

Indianapolis, IN just 4 seconds prior to ground impact during 3-1/2/turn spin;
Waxhaw, NC during stall/spin in base turn;
Deltona, FL just prior to ground impact from 10-turn spin;
Carrollton, TX just prior to ground impact after loss of control;
Melbourne, FL during stall/spin while maneuvering to avoid traffic.
Lanseria, South Africa during apparent low-altitude maneuvering and stall/spin
Poncins, France during apparent go-around stall/spin

??
If you have control and altitude above your hard-deck altitude, then attempt recovery or diversion or other process to avoid a crash. But when flying a Cirrus, keep in mind your need to remain vigilant about your height above ground to enable the use of CAPS.
The problem we faced was too many fatal accidents in which pilots attempted recovery and did not pull the CAPS handle.??The mantra ""Pull Early, Pull Often"" got COPA Pilots thinking.
Since then, the situation has changed. Only 1 of the 7 fatal accidents in 2013 were potential candidates for successful use of CAPS, otherwise 6 of 7 were never high enough for CAPS to be effective.??
Furthermore, 12 CAPS saves in the past two years involved decisions that avoided fatalities and serious injuries. Of those, 11 credit the threshold decision to pull early as their reason to deploy CAPS. The only other CAPS save involved a midair collision that tore off the empennage.
We're not done yet. We need both good aeronautical decision making and the skills to execute safe flights.

19,Update on pilot experience in Cirrus fatal accidents,Rick Beach,7/20/2013 13:08,,"Quite often after an accident in a Cirrus, aviation forums discuss the safety aspects of flying a Cirrus. One canard often appears, meaning a common misconception about the pilot experience when flying a Cirrus. This is the ""more money than brains"" sobriquet. Often, it applies to ab initio pilots should not training in a Cirrus.
When you look at the details, the pilot history shows a quite different pattern. Yes, low time-in-type appears quite often in Cirrus fatal accidents, but no, low total time does not. In fact, about half of the pilots, for whom we know their flight experience have more than 800 hours of total flight experience.

Only 4 pilots had less than 200 hours total time reported. Note, that accident investigations sometimes do not report pilot experience at all or not until the investigation is complete, which is the situation in 29 of the fatal accidents included here.
if ab initio training was a big problem, then one would expect accidents involving the training fleets at university aviation departments or the military training academies. Cirrus has succeeded in growing this part of their fleet sales, yet we do not see any of those pilots in these statistics.
However, low time-in-type experience does show up. Here's the frequency of accidents by time in type for the Cirrus SR2X:

Now, any pilot starting out in a Cirrus begins with zero time in type. And that low level of experience does contribute to worry about their envelope of safety and experience.
But the data does not support the idea that it is newbie pilots who are the predominant group of pilots who crash a Cirrus aircraft.

20,Cirrus Safety Milestone: Equal number of CAPS saves as fatal accidents in 12 months,Rick Beach,7/11/2013 16:46,,"The Cirrus community reached a significant safety milestone today: in the past 12 months, there have been an equal number of CAPS saves as fatal accidents -- 8 each.
When the Cirrus SR2X aircraft were introduced with the Cirrus Airframe Parachute System (CAPS), many of us anticipated the day when more people would survive bad situations in the air than died in fatal accidents. As of today, we've seen 8 fatal accidents since the accident on 11 July 2012 at Moscow, TN, and 8 CAPS saves including Pickens, SC on 22 July 2012. Interestingly, the number of people who survived in the CAPS saves exceeds the number of people who died in fatal accidents, 19 to 11.
Note: the NTSB accident database does not record all of the Cirrus fatal accidents or CAPS saves because several of them occurred outside of the US or in airplanes not registered in the US.??

21,Recorded flight data helps us fly more safely,Rick Beach,6/16/2013 23:56,,"What do we learn from recorded data in our Cirrus aircraft and how best to
use it?
     Some recent discussions about Cirrus accidents and flying safely prompt
this blog. All involved examining the recorded flight data often found, or not,
in Cirrus aircraft.
Recent Cirrus events involving flight data
The fatal aerobatic accident at Boynton Beach, FL, in November 2011
provided the most dramatic and widespread interest in what you can do with
recorded flight data from a Cirrus. From data extracted from the wreckage and published in
the NTSB public information docket in April, we animated three aileron rolls in
the accident aircraft and posted those on YouTube. Two online articles??in the aviation press, found??here and here,??picked up the NTSB probable cause reports released a few weeks
ago and linked to this COPA animation, resulting in an additional 20,000 views
within a week.

Engine problems plaguing several COPA members in the past few weeks prompted them to post their engine
data. Other COPA members helped diagnose anomalies, such as cylinder temperatures, oil
pressure indications, probes and connector issues, that saved time and money to get them fixed.
The most recent CAPS save in Cheltenham, UK on 6 June 2013 also involves
using recorded flight data to understand how the accident happened.
Preliminary access to some recorded data provided some insights into the upset,
although the data was not complete and further investigation continues.
Finally, a most mysterious CAPS event reminds us of the limitations of
recorded data. The parachute failed to deploy near Addison, TX in mid-May
2013. Unfortunately, that 6-pack Cirrus does not have flight data recording
capabilities, making the investigation much more challenging.
Recorded data sources in Cirrus avionics
As the Addison incident reminds us, not all Cirrus aircraft routinely
record flight data.
Those Cirrus aircraft with 6-pack avionics, including the Sandel SN3308
EHSI, Garmin 430 or Garmin 430W, and STEC autopilots, do not retain any flight data information.?? The ARNAV ICDS 2000 MFD has
an optional engine monitoring capability that does record data on a PCMCIA
card, but few operators go to the trouble to extract the data files, although
it can be done.
With the introduction of the Avidyne Entegra MFD, Cirrus operators began routine engine
monitoring. Downloaded data files via Zip drives or USB flash memory
drives could be analyzed on a laptop or via the web. Uploading those files to www.cirrusreports.com became a common
way for pilots, mechanics and knowledgeable experts on the COPA forums to share
access to the data and diagnose problems.
The Avidyne Entegra PFD sets the gold standard for flight data recording in
a Cirrus. These log files contain attitude information of how the plane flies
through the air at a sample rate of 5 Hertz, or 5 samples per second. Several
discrete data elements indicate selections made by the pilot when operating the
autopilot, navigation and configuration parameters. Unfortunately, access to these PFD log
files requires disassembly of the avionics box. Consequently, it takes an accident investigation to justify the effort and usually involves the NTSB
Vehicle Recorder Lab or Avidyne technical support to accomplish.
With the introduction of the Remote Data Module (RDM), somewhat crash
hardened and located in the tail of the aircraft, we now had a more robust
recording capability that often survived high-energy crashes and fires. Not
always, but more often. Unfortunately, the RDM samples flight data at a lower rate of 1 Hertz,
or 1 sample per second. Sometimes that slower rate misses abrupt maneuvers that
can be distinguished if the Avidyne PFD data is extracted.
The Cirrus Perspective records flight data on user-accessible SD cards.
This data stream may be limited depending on how the operator manages the
insertion and removal of those SD cards, but the same data is logged in the RDM
at the same 1 Hertz rate. Two interesting additional discrete status fields
show up in these newer Cirrus models: CAPS handle status as stowed or pulled,
which definitely determines if and when an occupant activated the Cirrus
parachute system.
The Avidyne R9 system also achieves the gold standard with 5 Hertz records
of attitude and position information.
At the moment, I have no knowledge of other after market avionics systems
and their capabilities for recording flight data, such as Aspen or Garmin
500/600, etc.
Oh, and don't forget. Some of your portable GPS units log flight tracks.
Occasionally, the NTSB Vehicle Recorder Lab gets a portable unit and can extract useful
data, but not often because of damage from the crash.
What can we learn?
Given all of this data, what use can we make of it?
Perhaps the most common use is uploading engine data for analysis. COPA
members use two common web services: www.cirrusreports.com
and more recently www.savvyanalysis.com.
By uploading the data files from any of the Cirrus avionics, these web tools
display strip charts of engine parameters. The data files can be shared
publicly or selectively so experts or volunteers can diagnose common
difficulties. We see many examples of simple solutions to intermittent problems that have benefited Cirrus owners, such as identifying weak spark plugs, plugged
fuel injectors or mistimed magnetos. Professional analysis can be requested
with data uploaded to SavvyAnalysis.
Accident reconstruction based on recorded flight data often provides a
visual story that numbers alone fail to tell. We get to see the plane on
approach to an airport at night??(alternatively, a pseudo daylight view)??or descending in a 10-turn spin or those
dramatic fatal aerobatics at lower and lower altitudes. With enough data, we
can look for things that happened earlier in the flight that might contribute
to later problems, such as meandering in marginal weather conditions, or
failing to track the final approach course before the upset.
These visualizations and reviews of flight data may happen in training
environments. Instructors may review
practice or real instrument approaches with clients to identify situations that
need improvement. Flight schools may routinely examine recorded flight data
files for examples where the student or client flew outside of permitted fight
parameters, such as bank angles, airspeeds, engine operation lean of peak, etc.??An iPad or iPhone app,CloudAhoy, can track portable GPS data and then visualize your flight in Google Maps or Google Earth.??
In commercial and institutional fleets, similar data files and their
reviews become the foundation for aviation Safety Management Systems. So far,
I'm unaware of any Cirrus operator going this deep, but the airplane and our
web infrastructure permits an operator to routinely gather the data and
conduct quality assurance reviews like an SMS. If anyone does this with
Cirrus aircraft, look for a university aviation department to be first.
How to create an accident visualization?
Based on the interest generated by the Boynton Beach animation, let me
describe the process from data file to video on YouTube.
Obviously, the flight data files provide the key ingredients.
In the Boynton Beach accident, the NTSB docket contains three data files, each of which contained enough of the necessary fields. Unfortunately, we do not have
timely access to these files and the NTSB often publishes widely varying extracts. This one was lucky. Public access happens only at the factual report stage, so end up waiting many
months or years. Then, we find key data elements missing,
such as the location or attitude fields.
In some cases, the NTSB has authorized Avidyne or Cirrus to provide COPA
with the raw PFD or RDM files. Those contain more details about attitude and
various discrete parameters. Unfortunately, the NTSB rarely shows an interest
in more data than just the accident flight, so analyzing prior flights that
might show patterns cannot be accomplished. But convincing the NTSB to change it's practices is another topic for later
. . .
Given location, altitude and attitude information, we can manipulate the
data fields into files suitable for either Google Earth KML files or X-Plane FDR
files. (Both file formats have sufficient documentation to make this
practical.) Those manipulations often require some clever spreadsheet hacking
to get the sequence and units into the right template. Occasionally, with jerky
data, interpolation with a bi-cubic spline can achieve more realistic flight
animations. Fortunately, mostly it's just math!
Finally, either Google Earth or X-Plane can record a movie file of the
flight visualization. With X-Plane, synthetic weather can be specified that
approximates the reported weather conditions near the accident location,
including precipitation, visibility and cloud decks.
The whole process results in a visual representation of data that looks
more familiar to pilots and instructors. So, within a minute or two, the whole
complex accident sequence can be presented and then discussed for a long time
afterwards.
Some gotchas
However, nothing remains simple.
We noted the lower sample rate of RDM. Sometimes, exciting things happen
with the plane over short time intervals and we wish that we had higher sample
rates of the Avidyne PFD. Consequently, the animations only depict what was
sampled and not what actually happened. But that is hard to remember at times.
Often, we lose data when the avionics power off. The Avidyne MFD only
writes to the storage file once a minute even though it samples more often. So,
we might lose the last minute of data in the accident sequence. Fortunately,
the Avidyne PFD and the RDM both write to storage more often.
Finally, the storage devices may be damaged. The NTSB Vehicle Recorder Lab
demonstrates a high degree of skill to recover data from broken boxes, cracked
circuit boards, burned chips, and even extracting the silicon chip die and
using microscope probes to read the data.
All this in search of data that helps COPA Pilots learn how to fly more
safely.

22,Another discussion of the Cirrus safety record,Rick Beach,5/25/2013 18:34,,"Recently, two things coincided to bracket the Cirrus safety innovations. First, Cirrus released a significant update on training resources about using the Cirrus Airframe Parachute System (CAPS) parachute system. Second, a COPA Pilot activated the CAPS system but the parachute failed to deploy.
Of course, this set off discussions across the aviation community about Cirrus safety innovations, often disparaging COPA Pilots and the Cirrus safety record.
The Cirrus fleet comes with many innovative safety features. Every Cirrus built has CAPS, a large multifunction display, autopilot and GPS navigator. Modern Cirrus airplanes come with integrated avionics that include protection against flying outside an envelope of safety -- not too fast, not too slow, not banked too much, etc.
So, why isn't the safety record of the Cirrus fleet much better than we hoped for?
These recent contrasting events prompted me to answer this question again.
After studying Cirrus accidents and our fleet demographics, my simple explanation is that Cirrus expanded the pilot pool.
Consequently, enough of those pilots are not as diligent or well trained as those who fly other models. Furthermore, given that 3/4 of NTSB accident causes are related to pilot causes, the airplane model doesn't matter. Except, Cirrus innovated in the market and attracted more pilots to general aviation, and hence gets most of the attention and blame.
Low time-in-type shows up as a huge factor in Cirrus fatal accidents. Over half of the accident pilots had less than 200 hours in a Cirrus. And of course, every COPA Pilots starts out a zero hours.
As for all those nifty safety features -- the chute, better avionics including envelope protection -- the technology is not yet simple enough or smart enough to avoid getting in the way.
The chute requires pilots to think through when they would use it, hence the mantra ""Pull Early, Pull Often!"" and the campaign to ""Consider CAPS"" in emergency situations and to train differently to prepare for use of this live-saving feature. We know that almost 2/3 of the Cirrus fatal accidents were good or great opportunities for using the parachute -- but pilots didn't and died.
Better avionics are cool, but also bring complexity. If you don't understand the system, then when something unusual happens how well prepared is the pilot to handle it?
It's a frustrating but well known situation -- innovation often comes with a valley of doom before things get better. Things got really worse in 2011. Now in 2013, they appear to be getting better. 
So much better that the 12-month fatal accident rate (1.30) is approaching it's lowest level since 2004, while the Cirrus fleet has grown about five times larger and the flying time grown about three times larger since then.
Something is working to improve safety in the past year. ""Pull Early, Pull Often!"" ""Consider CAPS"" And ""CAPS Works. Training Makes it Work For You!""

23,Letter to NTSB concerning early access to factual data,Rick Beach,4/4/2013 2:14,,"Today, I was invited to submit comments on a form used by NTSB investigators to prepare for press briefings after an aviation accident. This outreach to GA type clubs was part of the NTSB focus on GA safety seeking ways that can the NTSB help us by providing more factual information immediately after an accident. ""Improving General Aviation Safety"" was added to the NTSB Most Wanted List this year. After giving my comments, I took advantage of the dialog to make a point about early release of factual data.??
??
Email to NTSB Staff
Some additional background, since you invited a response! 
COPA has been acknowledged by knowledgable people as one of the leading aviation safety organizations for the quality of our accident discussions, for the extensive safety programs we created and operate, and for the results of our safety initiatives. COPA members show up in fatal accident reports about 1/2 of the rate you would expect compared to non-members if the attention to safety were uniformly distributed. And among active COPA members, meaning those who attend our recurrent training program or post on the discussion forum frequently, they show up about 1/4 of the expected rate.
As well, the COPA community routinely discusses accidents in the Cirrus fleet with expertise provided for weather factors,??flight path analysis and visualization, LiveATC recording analysis,??preflight and inflight decision making, regulations, mechanical issues, and lots of training and human factors issues. Fortunately, the number of Cirrus accidents has dropped precipitously in the past 6 months -- one fatal in Brazil in February, then one fatal in October -- in a fleet of 5000+ airplanes, that's dropped our fatal accident rate to 1.44 per 100,000 hours compared to the 2.38 of GA personal & business flying.
Consequently, COPA accident discussions have swerved towards discussing other notable GA accidents, most recently the Columbia 350 that crashed Sunday near Winston-Salem. The interest in safety seems insatiable among our community members.
In June, I attended the NTSB GA Safety Forum and spoke with several NTSB staff about exactly this issue -- how to keep pilots more engaged in safety discussions.??
In August, I provided the attached email message to Avidyne who met with the NTSB Board and discussed ways to make additional factual data available to the GA community.
Subject:??COPA posts by date for most active accident discussion
Can you guess when the NTSB reports were issued?

Accident date -- Nov 26Preliminary report -- Dec 7Factual report -- April 27Probable cause -- May 16
There were a total of 665 posts and 29,404 views. (Sorry, but charting views by date is not feasible.)
My point with this slide was the great and timely activity soon after the accident is a teachable moment. We have the attention of a large audience, perhaps 1000+ pilots who read these COPA accident discussion threads. We have little factual information at that time. You see the small bump in activity after the Preliminary Report -- and then nothing until the Factual Report and Probable Cause reports come out in record time, just 6-7 months. BTW, the oldest Cirrus fatal accident still without a Factual Report occurred 32 months ago (WPR10FA383 at Phoenix, AZ) and there are 14 fatal accidents without Factual Reports.
There are two items of factual data that would be of timely interest to the COPA community: 1) the flight path data recorded by the airplane and 2) the experience and recent training history of the pilot. ??
I realize that the Cockpit Displays Analysis Report would need to be sequestered until the Factual Report, since that contributes to the investigation process. However, the factual data of the flight path would help clarify what the airplane was doing during the accident chain so that the teachable moment can focus on what actually happened rather than wild speculation of what someone imagines could have happened.
The interest in the facts about the pilot's recent training history reflects both a timely desire to encourage better and more effective training among the COPA Pilot community as well as encourage the NTSB to place greater emphasis on human factors in their investigation process. Major accident investigation reports include a section entitled Human Factors, but most GA accidents do not. Yet, pilots are known to be determined as the cause of a huge percentage of GA accidents. BTW, a recent count of Cirrus fatal accidents revealed that 25 of 26 NTSB probable causes were attributable to pilot actions -- that's 96%!
We have a teachable moment right after the accident during the intense discussion. The NTSB could help our community by sharing factual data as soon as it is available.
This is a change in the lengthy investigation timeline, for which I appreciate the important reasons for due deliberation by the investigation team. But what's being done now is not working, so something like this needs to be considered for change.

Have fun!

Safety: Pull Often!
by Rick Beach

What a difference a year makes.
In the last half of 2011, we saw 11 fatal Cirrus
accidents and only one CAPS save. In the last half??of 2012, we saw six
fatal accidents and four CAPS saves. A year later, that's about half the number
of fatal accidents and way more CAPS saves. COPA had something to do with it.
In each of the four CAPS saves, those pilots
credit their training and the COPA community for preparing them to take action
when they needed to.
Matt Richmond, Pickens, S.C.
I was just doing what I trained to do.
Matt flies a Cirrus SR22 as a corporate pilot
and CSIP instructor. On this trip, he had three company employees returning
home when at 9,000 feet the plane experienced a loss of engine power. He could
see the Pickens airport directly underneath them, so he diverted.
I set up for the best deadstick landing ever,
but as I lowered the flaps, the plane shook and didn't respond??as I
expected. I could see that I wasn't going to make the runway and in a split
second, as I descended below 1,000 feet, I pulled the CAPS handle. We landed in
trees, actually we were suspended in trees. My wing was touching the ground,
but I knew we were okay if we stayed put. People would find us. I kept my
passengers calm, which wasn't that easy, and we waited for rescue.
Matt spoke to the Cirrus Training Symposium
about that decision:
Let me reiterate how happy I am to be part of a
network of Cirrus folks who are so passionate about safety that they would
disseminate such excellent resources. My buddy told me about the outcomes video
on the COPA web site.
(Editor's note: The link to the COPA M9 safety
presentation by Rick Beach is at??http://goo.gl/Sr6HM)
I sat and watched it over lunch and without it,
I doubt that I would have pulled the chute. After watching all those outcomes,
you can put yourself in those situations, consider your criteria, get a
realistic image of do or don't. That video got the ball rolling and planted the
seed. When it hit the fan, I just did what I was trained to do.
When the plane failed me, I think it was the
prop governor but they haven't told me yet, you don't have time to think and
stare. You need to start acting. I was doing everything I knew to get the plane
on the runway, flying the posted airspeeds, but I exhausted my skill set. Rick,
your video saved all of those people on that airplane!
Bill Sprague, Birmingham, Ala.
Under the circumstances, I went through the
procedures; pulling the chute was the last resort. I knew I was at 1,000 feet.
If I hadn't pulled the chute, I don't think either one of us would be here
right now.
Bill Sprague, a COPA member, was flying home
with a passenger, planning to stop at Birmingham for fuel. On the approach, in
IMC, things didn't feel right. The weather had worsened and the ceiling
dropped. As he crossed the outer marker and descended to 2,000 feet, he was
still in the clouds.
At this point I felt uncomfortable and declared
I was going missed. I was acknowledged by Tower and told to fly the runway
heading. I told Tower I was not sure where that was, at this time I was no
longer on the approach. Tower told me to turn to a 180-degree heading
and climb to 4,000 feet.
When I turned, the plane just whipped to the
side. By the time I leveled it out, it felt like it was just falling. I looked
at my altimeter, showing 1,700 feet, knowing field was 700 feet, I knew I had
1,000 feet before I hit the ground, so I reached up, and as a last resort, I
pulled the chute on that plane. 



Cirrus N80KW landed in a vacant lot in downtown
Birmingham, Ala., after a successful CAPS pull.

??
What makes this accident particularly
significant was the similarity of disorientation on approach in IMC with one
CAPS save and two fatal Cirrus accidents, all within three weeks. At Willard,
Mo., while returning from a ball game late at night, the plane crossed the
final approach fix, executed a missed approach, but on the second approach
crashed just inside the final approach fix in a high-energy impact. At Gary,
Ind., the pilot was cleared for the approach but crashed about a mile short of
the airport in a high- energy impact. Fortunately, Bill Sprague's scenario had
a survivable outcome.
I can [attest] to the fact that the parachute
system and safety design of the Cirrus saved our lives.
I just did what I was trained to do. We're
trained to pull the parachute in this plane. You just do it that way. A last
resort. When you have nothing else left to do, pull the chute.
I hope this information is helpful to other Cirrus
pilots.
Bob Wolff, Show Low, Ariz.
Everyone's first question to me is always how
did I do in my crash landing?
Well ... I tell them I did not crash land ... I
made a parachute landing.
On an early morning flight on his way to a
vacation in Mexico, COPA member Bob Wolff lost oil pressure at 14,000 feet. He
diverted to Show Low, Ariz.
I told Center I could see the runway, but I was
not going to make it there, and I was going to turn right to get out from over
the forest and pull the parachute in an open area, and for them to send help
... this was about 7:30 in the morning.
I pulled the mixture off, and pulled the chute.
That's quite a ride, and a pitch up to what seems like 80 degrees to the
surface - an E-Ticket ride for you old Disney fans. I was about 2,000 feet AGL
and at 95 knots when I deployed. After what I estimated as the third swing, I
hit the ground athwart-ships, or for you non-sailors, with the left wing
leading the way.
Bob made a quick assessment of his situation,
exited the plane to get away from a potential fire, but couldn't find his
phone. He was safely on the ground, knew where he was, and just needed folks to
come find him. That took a while.
I slipped in and retrieved my Garmin 496 and my
hand- held radio. Away from the plane I tried to raise someone on the radio, no
luck, and dang, I cannot remember the last center frequency. I write down my
lat/long: N34d 13.128' W109d 52.430'. I went back into the plane and realized
that the ELT had not yet activated, so I switched it on manually, and grabbed
more things.
I still couldn't find my cell phone. I looked
and looked. Each time I extracted more and more gear from the airplane.

Cirrus N800RW landed under canopy in an open
field in Arizona after a catastrophic loss of oil pressure.

Now, I was starting to look for a camping spot
in the trees, and do my best Boy Scout thing. I kept a satellite phone in my
emergency supplies, so I broke it out and tried dialing 911 a dozen times
before someone answered. I read my lat/long to him, was cut off, called back,
and read it again. At that point, I called my wife in Mexico and let her know I
would be late for dinner, and that I was fine, and was cut off again.
Besides being well prepared for survival in the
mountains, Bob had time and resources to think through his plans. Eventually,
the 911 operator on the sat phone connected him with the USAF Rescue
Coordination Center. They took his location and told him to turn off his ELT.
They also called his cell phone, which rang and rang and rang, helping Bob
locate it under the rudder pedals on the co-pilot side. Bob had been expecting
a helicopter to fly over, but he saw nothing, so he used his paragliding skills
to re-inflate the parachute as a visual marker.

Bob reinflated the parachute as a visual marker
(mid-photo) to help searchers find him.

After about two hours, with me thinking someone
with my coordinates could find me, I walked up a gentle slope towards the only
sound I had heard, and looked at my phone - wow three bars. I called 911. I
gave the dispatcher my info and she asked me if I heard the sirens... no, I
said, but I thought I heard one earlier. She asked me to walk in that
direction, after several hundred yards, way off in the distance, I saw a flash
of white, and told her I saw a truck, it's a white propane truck. She told the
searchers, and low and behold a detective sees the propane truck go by a few
minutes later ... he must be that away Tonto ....
I kept walking, and then he saw the parachute
above the trees. It worked.
The sheriff's detective insisted that Bob go
with the paramedics and that he would take care of deflating the parachute.
Unfortunately, the winds picked up and the parachute flipped the plane over
onto its back. That created a lot of misinformation. Bob continued his trip to
Mexico and recuperated with family over the Thanksgiving holiday.
John Nixon, Gilgandra, NSW, Australia

John Nixon's self-portrait after descending under CAPS. VH-WYH experienced a catastrophic loss of oil, the engine seized, and John followed his training from the CPPP at Wagga Wagga to pull the CAPS handle and avoid an off-airport landing.

I own a plane exactly the same as the one I was
flying and knew all about the ballistic parachute safety system.
Not many people in the world have set off an
aircraft emergency parachute, but I had attended a training course at Wagga
about 18 months ago and knew exactly what to do.
John Nixon encountered an engine problem while
flying a company plane on business. As a COPA member who attended the CPPP at
Wagga Wagga, Australia in 2010, he acted on that information and training to
avoid an off-airport landing in a field.

Cirrus VH-WYH on the ground after landing under
CAPS. Note the airbags on both front seats have deployed, which may be the
first such deployment under parachute.

A local news story captured John's superb
explanation of how he handled this emergency.
We were on the ground less than a minute after
the oil gauge indicated the problem. Adrenaline kicked in and I automatically
did what was needed.
The chute went off like a missile out the back
of the aircraft and made a hell of a noise. We came to an almighty stop and the
plane went into a nose down attitude as the parachute inflated.
About six seconds later, the line cutters (small
explosive devices) at the back of plane went off, leveling the aircraft. The
ground was approaching pretty quickly, but I was calm and Tom was calm. He was
a good passenger and did everything he was supposed to do.
The plane hit the ground on its wheels. The undercarriage?? collapsed to take the impact of the crash,
just as it is supposed to do. The aircraft seats are especially designed to
take the force of a crash, so the occupants don't break their backs. The seats
and the emergency airbag system gave us good protection. Everything worked like
a charm.

Each of these successful CAPS saves prompted
extensive discussions on the COPA forums. You may find valuable lessons from
these discussions as COPA members explore how they might handle similar
situations.

25,Recalibrating the flying hours for the Cirrus fleet,Rick Beach,12/9/2012 0:07,,"In the past few months, COPA has worked with Cirrus Aircraft engineering to recalibrate the estimates of flying time for the 5,300 aircraft produced since mid-1999. 
The Cirrus reliability engineering team maintains a database of aircraft hours by serial number based on information gleaned from warranty cards, service bulletins and AD compliance cards, and other sources. They then fit a Weibull distribution commonly used for failure analysis and reliability engineering. From that distribution, one can estimate the flying time for the whole fleet.
Cirrus Aircraft shares that flying time data with COPA so that we can calculate the accident rate versus 100,000 hours of flying time in the Cirrus fleet.
As you might guess, this methodology of using warranty cards gives great accuracy for the newer planes in the fleet but overlooks most out-of-warranty planes. (One joking suggestion was to issue an AD so that all airworthy airplanes, no matter their age, would have to report their Hobbs time. Cirrus didn't like that idea at all!)
With the 10-year life limit of the CAPS parachute system, we have an opportunity to gather data from these older airplanes. Unfortunately, there is no requirement for Service Centers to report to Cirrus any information on the installation of the parachutes. But with only a limited number of SCs qualified to do parachute repacks, there are fewer sources of data. 
At Oshkosh 2012, I met with three of the most active SCs and encouraged them to review their records and share the Hobbs time of planes that they had already done parachute repacks. 
With those three SCs, I quickly obtained 64 data points (out of about 300 eligible aircraft). The results were pretty surprising. The lowest time was only 376 hours -- for a 10-year old SR22! The highest time was 3209 hours. The average was 1271 and the median was 1143 (indicating that more planes were below average hours).
Cirrus Aircraft expanded the data collection and updated the parameters of their Weibull distribution. The result drops the estimated flying time by about 20 percent. That is, the fleet crossed the 5,000,000 hour number about August 2012. And the annual flying time is now estimated at 700,000 hours per year.
What remains unchanged is the observation that new Cirrus aircraft fly a lot of hours. That data was always highly accurate for the fleet. But now we know that older Cirrus aircraft fly much less than new aircraft, just as many of you suspected. Only now, we have some better data to work with.
My updated accident statistics are now using those recalibrated fleet hours.

26,"In Last Six Months, Half the Fatal Accidents and Way More CAPS Saves",Rick Beach,12/8/2012 11:03,,"Compare the past six months
with the same time last year. You will see half the fatal accidents and way more CAPS saves.
What a difference a year
makes!
Last year, in the last six months of
2011, we saw 11 fatal accidents in Cirrus SR2X aircraft with only a single CAPS
save.* This year, in the same six months of 2012, we saw six fatal accidents and
four CAPS saves. (The other six months were a wash with no difference.) 
Last year, 22 people died and four seriously injured in those
fatal accidents, and this year only 12 died with two seriously injured. Last
year, one person survived a CAPS save, and this year nine people survived.
2012 had half the fatal
accidents, half the fatalities and a huge increase in CAPS saves and survivors.

Now, we understand that the decline in aviation accidents
may be affected by too many factors to draw any predictive conclusions. But it
feels good to see the big drop in the number of people who died in Cirrus
airplane accidents. And it truly amazes me that the number of CAPS saves
increased so dramatically.
Two interesting tidbits. In 2011, none of those pilots were COPA members, neither the pilots in fatal accidents or the lone CAPS pilot (who was trained in the military and also flies fighters).
An interesting tidbit about those 2012 CAPS saves: every one of those four CAPS pilots credit
COPA with preparing them to pull the red CAPS handle when faced with an
life-threatening emergency. Three were COPA members who had attended a CPPP
( COPA Pilot Proficiency Program), and one was a CSIP (Cirrus Standardized
Instructor Pilot) who spent his lunch watching the COPA M9 Safety Keynote
online that introduced ""0. CAPS .... CONSIDER"" for emergency procedures
When interviewed, they all said something like ""I just did what I trained to do.""
For reference, here are the four COPA forum threads about those four CAPS saves:
CAPS event #36
 in SR22 N138CK near Pickens, SC on 22 July 2012
CAPS event #37 in SR22 N80KW near Birmingham, AL on 6 Oct 2012
CAPS event #38 in SR22 N800RW near Show Low, AZ [16 Nov 2012]
CAPS event #39 in SR22 VH-WYH near Gilgandra, NSW, Australia [21 Nov 2012]

* A CAPS save is defined when people survive a successful deployment of the Cirrus Airframe Parachute System. A full history of CAPS events can be found here.",0,2
27,Refining what we call a CAPS Save,Rick Beach,11/22/2012 19:25,,"In the accident history of Cirrus accidents, we appreciate the survival of people after a CAPS event due to the innovative safety feature of the Cirrus Airframe Parachute System (CAPS). 
When the CAPS parachute system has been activated within design parameters, no one has died and there has never been a post-impact fire.
However, the language we use to talk about these events creates some confusion. In photographs of several fatal accidents, one sees the red/white parachute but wonders if the pilot or others in the plane attempted to use the CAPS parachute system. Most often, those situations involve the rocket firing because of impact forces triggering the ignition mechanism, not by pulling the red handle prior to ground impact.
This is my attempt to clarify the language we might use to describe what we know about CAPS events.

CAPS event -- any time in flight when the CAPS system is activated, or attempted to be activated, before ground impact


CAPS pull -- a CAPS event with evidence that someone in the cockpit pulled the red handle prior to ground impact


CAPS save -- hmmm ... when someone survives a CAPS event, but this requires some additional distinctions.

To clarify when a CAPS event can be considered a CAPS save, we need to investigate the circumstances of the accident. Sometimes, the wreckage shows clear evidence that the parachute was activated after ground impact, hence, had no effect on the crash sequence, and could not be considered a save, even if there were survivors. Here's an example photograph of a crashed Cirrus with the parachute stretched out when the rocket ignited due to impact forces on the ground. Unfortunately, all occupants died in the crash.

Typical arrangement of a CAPS parachute stretched away from the wreckage after the rocket ignites from ground-impact forces and extracts the parachute, which never inflates but falls to the ground still folded. Wreckage photograph from fatal accident #30 in N482SR at Faribault, MN on 25 November 2007.
The determination from photographic evidence and reports from investigators helps identify when and how the CAPS parachute system was activated, whether the parachute deployed, and whether anyone survived the accident. Consider these distinctions:

CAPS activation how -- the rocket and parachute system activates either by a pull of the red handle in the cockpit, by impact forces, or by fire

Note that a pull of the red handle may be by anyone in the airplane, normally the pilot, but in two CAPS saves, the handle was pulled by the right-seat passenger (Indianapolis, IN; and Bull Bay, Jamaica)

CAPS activation where -- whether the CAPS system activated in the air prior to any impact, after first impact but before the ground, or after ground impact

Note that activation after the first impact with a tree has happened at Porter, TX and Asturias, Spain, which was obviously at a very low altitude. In both cases, the parachute had no effect on the outcome and did not fully inflate.

CAPS airspeeds -- whether outside or within design parameter of airspeed less than 133 KIAS

Note 
that five activations above 133 KIAS have been recorded, and only one at
 300+ KIAS was fatal (Norden, CA). Otherwise, people have survived activations at airspeeds of 
168, 170, 187 and 190 KIAS at Haverstraw, NY; Mathias, WV; Horton, UK; and Bennett, CO 
respectively.

CAPS altitudes -- whether outside or within design parameters of loss of altitude of 400 feet in level flight or 920 feet in a 1-1/2 turn spin/dive

Note that to date, in every CAPS activation within design parameters, all aboard have survived. In a few cases, activation below 400 feet has been survivable (Idabel, OK at 336 feet AGL, and New Orleans, LA reported at 300 feet above Lake Ponchartrain).

CAPS deployments -- whether complete, partial, never inflated, or failed

Note that testing and recorded data confirms that complete parachute deployment requires 8 seconds from rocket ignition to parachute extraction and opening regulated by the slider to firing of the line cutters and disreefing the rear riser to level the aircraft under canopy. Partial deployment might occur when not enough time occurred prior to ground impact or when the parachute was extracted but never inflated sufficiently to activate the line cutters or when the line cutters failed to disreef the parachute. In all accidents to date, investigators found some examples of the first two scenarios and no examples of the line cutter failures.

CAPS survivors -- the number of people who survived

Note that in extreme scenarios when the parachute only partially deployed after activation too low in a spin, the impact forces could cause fatalities. The pilot in the Indianapolis accident died while his three passengers survived after activation just 4 seconds prior to impact at 528 feet AGL in a 3-1/2 turn spin, as determined from recorded data.
We can now define a CAPS Save as an event in which CAPS was activated and 
the deployment was either complete or partial and people survived. Essentially, a CAPS save occurs when someone survives an accident where the parachute affected the outcome.
This gives rise to numerous edge cases, such as these.
Lexington, KY: not a CAPS save because the parachute did not activate prior to ground impact. The pilot stated on the radio his intentions to pull CAPS but it was never activated; the pilot successfully executed a forced landing and a witness describes the plane coming to a stop and then the parachute fired; obviously, the CAPS system worked, just not while in the air. My speculation is that either the pilot used an incorrect technique or the CAPS cable routing was improper, which had been subject to two service bulletins issued prior to this flight but only one of the two had been complied with on the accident airplane.
Norden, CA: not a CAPS save because the parachute ripped off the airframe and the pilot did not survive. The pilot reported icing and lost control in a high-speed dive, which engineers estimate at over 300 knots. The parachute activated but did not successfully inflate at that high airspeed.
Indianapolis, IN: a CAPS save despite a low-altitude deployment and the fatal injury to the pilot. The passenger activated the parachute according to interviews. The recorded data shows activation at 528 feet AGL just 4 seconds before impact. However, the parachute decelerated the plane as it descended prior to ground impact with a water retention pond in a residential area.
Sydney, Australia: not a CAPS save because the rocket took an anomalous trajectory and failed to extract the parachute. This activation was at a very low level, estimated to be 90 to 120 feet AGL, during a forced landing attempt on a motorway. An Airworthiness Directive was issued to improve the pickup collar that might have misalignment between the rocket and the parachute bridle.
Deltona, FL: not a CAPS save because the parachute was activated at too low an altitude to have an effect and both occupants died. The plane entered a 10-turn spin during slow-flight practice and witnesses describe the parachute coming out about 200 feet above the ground, however, no deceleration was noted in the recorded data, so the activation was likely very close to ground impact.
Boulder, CO: not a CAPS save because investigators determined that the activation was due to impact forces of a mid-air collision and both occupants died. The plane hit a glider tow-plane at a 90-degree angle at cruise speed and the parachute deployed and lowered the burning wreckage under canopy. What was remarkable was that at least three people on the ground captured the descent on video, which was repeatedly shown on newscasts around the world.
Porter, TX: not a CAPS save because the parachute, while activated and deployed never inflated and never affected the outcome. The pilot failed to gain altitude during a go-around and pulled the red handle after first impact with a tree, but so low and so close to ground impact that the 90-foot risers extended the parachute but it never inflated or decelerated the airplane.

28,On cognitive dissonance in flying,Rick Beach,7/16/2012 16:48,,"In the thread, Cirrus fatal #89 in SR20 N764RV near Moscow, TN on 11 July 2012, while discussing the early indications that the accident pilot departed VFR and encountered IMC conditions, the difficulty of people being offended or put-off by comments made by more experienced and wise airmen prompted Rob Apens to suggest ""cognitive dissonance"" was getting in the way to less experienced airmen benefiting from those comments.?? This prompted my reflection captured here.
 Robert  Apens:
Just a quick observation and suggestion.
Seems when ..., a highly experienced, prudent and wise airman says 
anything that might touch a nerve, cognitive dissonance* kicks in and 
people get offended.
While some may suggest that ... make the message
 more palatable, I'd suggest that it is in the recipient's own best 
interest to find wisdom and knowledge in what is posted, however posted.
 ??Because I suspect that ... the less experienced,
 less wise pilots who look for reasons to be offended are the ones who 
are more at risk.
Rob, your note about ""cognitive dissonance"" stayed 
with me since you posted it. I understand how you meant it when readers 
fail to relate the advice they read or hear to their own situations 
because of the dissonance with their own cognitive self-assessment or 
understanding of the situation. To them, it doesn't apply.
Perhaps you hit on something that is a more significant problem 
-- the dissonance between our own self-assessment of what we would do 
and what we actually do do in a real-world situation. To me, this does 
apply, and now I need to figure out what do I do about it?
So in these discussions, wise aviators say things that they have 
come to believe, things like ""this accident is so preventable"" or ""there
 were so many times to break the accident chain"" or ""this accident is 
clearly an example of breaking the current rules.""
Yet, when I 
examine the cognitive dissonance as it applies to my own thinking, I 
realize that I could have gotten into that VFR-in-IMC situation and 
experienced something similar. What? The COPA safety zealot could have 
an inadvertent encounter with IMC when flying VFR? Yes. Has happened 
several times, obviously with successful outcomes as I am still here. 
But it happened -- and I need to address the cognitive dissonance in my 
own self-assessment of my flying.
The rule is simple -- VFR flight requires certain visibility and cloud distances.
The weather is complex
 -- conditions now don't persist later, and some weather situations 
sneak up on you, especially in geographical regions with which you have 
less familiarity to recognize the changes.
Here are some of my personal examples:

early in my flying experience, I attempted to fly off shore under an overcast
 that was high enough at the north end of Camp Pendelton and the south 
end of Camp Pendelton, but those METARs didn't describe the drop in 
cloud heights in between -- climbed in IMC, confessed, and got an pop-up
 IFR clearance to continue


a couple of years ago, cruising in the area of big California fires, the visibility in smoke
 was pretty minimal but consistent, until it wasn't and I couldn't see 
ahead, although I could see straight down from 13,500 feet (does VFR 
visibility count vertically? ) -- shut off all the vents, climbed in
 IMC to top the smoke at 16,000 feet, confessed and continued VFR


just three weeks ago, flying over the Aspen area on my way to 
Canada and the M10 migration, which is during the monsoon season in the 
Southwest, I departed early and was over the mountains early as 
recommended, yet the clouds were forming faster than I could get past them,
 and cloud levels were dropping, so I began deviating to fly over lower 
terrain and towards clearer skies, yet things kept changing as I 
approached one ridge after another, which made my route appear erratic 
and inconsistent to maintain some semblance of VFR separation distances 
-- this wasn't thunderstorm activity yet, but simply bumpy clouds 
getting in my way


finally, departing coastal airports with scattered clouds that form the marine layer often surprise folks with ""sucker holes"" -- breaks in the clouds that close up before you get there -- and if the marine layer really is cumulus clouds due to advection rather than stratus clouds in a layer, you have more grief you didn't expect
  

Let me be clear about my intention for sharing all this -- cognitive dissonance applies to all of us. 
In
 normal circumstances we would behave normally and rationally. And then 
we get into an abnormal situation and we don't. In particular, we may 
get lulled into believing one thing about the situation that is not 
right, and then we have to deal with a situation we profess to have 
never allowed ourselves to get into! In retrospect, we might not even 
believe that we did that -- but we did.
So, Rob, thanks for the insight.

29,Early Reflections on CAPS Pull #32 by Dick McGlaughlin in the Bahamas,Rick Beach,1/10/2012 6:34,,"Dr. Richard ?€?Dick?€? McGlaughlin and his daughter Elaine made national news after they used the Cirrus Airframe Parachute System (CAPS) to splash down in the azure blue waters near the Bahamas.?? Their landing under that big red-and-white parachute counted as the 28th CAPS save of 53 survivors since 1999 when Cirrus Aircraft introduced this rocket-fired parachute on the SR20 and SR22 models.
(Photo: US Coast Guard.?? Cirrus SR22 N732EA in the water off Andros Island, Bahamas, with two people in a life raft holding onto the risers from the Cirrus Airframe Parachute System)
Dick frequently posts on the web forum of the Cirrus Owners and Pilots Association (COPA), where he is a respected and popular contributor, and he has already posted some details of the experience.
Does your engine sound different flying over water?
Many of us worry that our engines sound differently as soon as we embark on a long trip over water.?? Most often it?€?s our imagination. 
This time, the engine in Dick?€?s plane stopped! 
First the oil pressure dropped slightly and within three or four minutes went to zero.?? Then the engine seized and the propeller stopped. Elaine called it insane, as they were flying along at 9,500 feet but now the prop was straight up and down!
Haiti Beckons
Dick and Elaine were on their way to Haiti where Dick, a medical doctor, has regularly flown himself and supplies and volunteers to offer medical services after the earthquake and cholera epidemic.?? In fact, Dick has recruited several other COPA members who purchased hard-to-find supplies and flew them to Haiti in their personal Cirrus aircraft.?? A Cirrus can fly this route direct non-stop, when there is fuel available in Haiti.?? The route takes you close to Andros Island, the big island in the Bahamas.?? 

(Dr. Dick McGlaughlin with a recovering patient, Crystal, in Haiti soon after the earthquake in June 2010.)
The Engine Stops Over Water
Cruising at 9,500 feet when the engine stops, the Cirrus will glide about 15 miles in about 10 minutes.?? The advice to trim all the way back gave Dick a quick and effective way to establish best glide airspeed.
He declared an emergency with Miami air traffic controllers and headed for nearest land.?? A big plus was the warm Atlantic Ocean.???? On board, they had a life vests, life raft, a personal locator beacon for search and rescue, and a hammer to break the windows if the doors would not open.
Dick and Elaine got within 2 miles of Andros Island, but not close enough to land there.
Emergency Landing on Water: To Ditch or Pull CAPS Handle?
A COPA Pilot can choose to enter the water either by flying to the surface and ditching as slow as practical, or by deploying the airframe parachute and descending under canopy to a splash down. 
People survive conventional ditching over 90% of the time, although some people survive the landing only to die from exposure or drowning afterwards.?? Good survival and rescue equipment helps the prepared.?? COPA recommends following the advice of our aviation survival partner, the Equipped to Survive Foundation.
Five COPA Pilots have deployed the CAPS parachute over water.?? The results were generally favorable, with some concerns about back injuries, and how quickly people can get out of the plane.?? One pilot died when his son pulled the handle so close to the ground in a spin that the parachute did not have much time to slow the plane.?? So, COPA encourages pilots to pull early and prepare for egress, the things you need to do as you exit the plane in the water.
Dick admits to being unsure of what would happen with a CAPS splash down, but he determined that he would pull at 2,000 feet above the ocean.?? Actually, he got impatient and pulled at 2,300 feet!
The Rocket Goes Off!
The parachute in the Cirrus remains hidden inside the rear of the plane until the pilot, or any other person in the plane, pulls a red handle in the cockpit roof.?? That cable needs a good yank, first out of the holder and then down to activate the rocket igniter.
That rocket travels fast! 
Within a couple of seconds the rocket blasts through a protective cover, pulls the heavy parachute bag out of the plane, rips the risers out of hidden channels to hold the plane at three points, two in front and one in the rear, then stretches the 90-foot risers to full length.???? No more than two seconds and the plane begins to slow down immediately.?? Typical deployments show that after about 8 seconds, the parachute slowed all forward momentum and the plane descends level under canopy at about 20 mph or 1700 feet per minute.

(Deployment sequence for the Cirrus Airframe Parachute System.?? Source: Cirrus Aircraft SR22 Pilot Operating Handbook)
The parachute slows you down from 100 mph to zero in eight seconds.?? As Dick recalls, he cautioned Elaine to tighten her seatbelt low across her hips.?? Yet the jerk in those first few seconds caused her to bend forward and bump her head on the dashboard.
Simulating The Cirrus Parachute
Several aircraft simulators exist where COPA Pilots can experience what happens when the CAPS parachute deploys. Dick visited the simulator in Atlanta that moves the platform and pilot seats to create the illusion of flying.?? That?€?s where he pulled the simulated CAPS handle.?? The simulator creates the jerk and points the nose down until the parachute slows the plane when it levels the plane as if under canopy. That prepared him for the dramatic view from the front window as the nose drops and you are looking at the expanse of blue water!

(A right-seat passenger activates the red CAPS handle in the roof of the cockpit in the Simtrain full-motion simulator located at The Flight Academy at North Las Vegas Airport)
COPA Pilots can locate simulators, especially ones with CAPS handles, across the US and the newest full-motion sim in Poland.
Water Splash Down
Cirrus designed the CAPS system with energy absorbing features to protect people when coming straight down.?? The engineers equate the impact to a drop of about 13 feet.
The main landing gear legs bend to absorb energy.?? The seat bottoms contain a light honeycomb structure that crushes to absorb energy.?? The four-point seat belts keep your back straight against the seat.?? The pilot and co-pilot control sticks, the yokes, mount off to the side to avoid impaling injuries.?? The instrument panel is padded to absorb energy.
Note: while many Cirrus airplanes include airbags, they are designed for frontal impacts and do not operate in vertical impacts typical of a CAPS parachute landing.
Dick vividly describes their splash down as a hard landing, harder than he expected.?? But both he and Elaine were uninjured.?? The cabin quickly began to fill with water through the fresh air vents, so they felt urgency to get out of the plane.?? While Elaine?€?s door would not open, the pilot door opened easily and both got onto the wing with their life vests and life raft.
The raft promptly overturned when inflated and Dick struggled to get it right way up.?? From the pictures, this single-tube four-person life raft looks very tiny and quite modest.?? Think carefully about your choice of life raft as?? your survival waiting for rescue may depend upon keeping warm and out of the sun or stormy weather.

(Dick and Elaine McGlauglin in their modest four-person life raft holding onto the risers of the Cirrus Airframe Parachute System trying to stay with the plane and not drift away.?? Source: US Coast Guard)
Coast Guard Rescue
Any search and rescue effort requires coordination among many agencies.?? However, the sound and sight of a helicopter dropping a rescue swimmer makes the news.?? The rescuers reported seeing the parachute about eight miles away.?? The life raft was just a dot on the ocean. 

(Rescue swimmer from the US Coast Guard prepares Elaine and Dick McGlauglin for hoisting into the helicopter.?? Source: US Coast Guard)
Unfortunately, when the helicopter approached the plane, the downwash reinflated the parachute and lifted it about 30 feet in the air.?? Dick and Elaine had been holding onto the risers to avoid drifting away from their most visible rescue streamer, the 50-foot diameter red-and-white parachute.???? Stay with the plane until rescued!
The plane sank in about 10 feet of water, although the parachute seemed to keep it upright.
The helicopter took the McGlauglins to Nassau for an unplanned hotel stay.?? They soon arranged to continue their travel to Haiti.
Lessons for COPA Pilots
The Cirrus Airframe Parachute System worked again over water with two survivors without injuries.?? Anticipate the need to use CAPS for an emergency by practicing in a simulator with a CAPS handle.?? Consider carefully your survival and rescue equipment for the conditions that you fly over, not just at your departure and destination.?? Pull early over water to give yourself time to prepare for splash down and egress from the airplane.
And always fly with a personal locator beacon attached to you by a cord or lanyard.?? If it isn?€?t with you, then it can?€?t save you!",0,1
