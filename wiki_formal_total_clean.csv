Welcome to COPApedia as a Wiki,2,Nose Wheel Pant and Strut Beating at Oshkosh 2017,https://www.cirruspilots.org/copa/member/sr_aircraft/w/copapedia/949.nose-wheel-pant-and-strut-beating-at-oshkosh-2017.aspx,No, Stuart Simek,2017-07-31,0,"Yesterday, I made my first trek over to Oshkosh this year for Airventure. I've never been before, and wanting to have another pilot, I decided to bring my CSIP instructor and 2 other PAX. I didn't have time to spend overnight so we just did a quick day trip, plus the flight was only an hour and a half from my home base.After a fun day at the show we went back to airplane which was parked on the grass in row 625 in the North Forty and fired her up and began to taxi back to the edge of the concrete taxiway. As all of you know, any airplane needs more power to get going in the grass, even more so with 4 people, so once we got out of our parking spot I kept the plane going with the yolk all the way back at a safe and reasonable taxi speed. The parking rows were rather narrow at the end of the day and you had to pay attention to your wing clearance on both sides, so far so good. Upon reaching the transition edge of the grass to the concrete taxiway the nose gear made a loud bang and scraping noise (like when the front air spoiler of your car sometime sounds going up or down a driveway from the road) that didn't sound very good at all. I looked over at my CSIP instructor and cursed with several expletives! The plane kept moving and I was waiting for the same noise to occur when the mains cleared onto the concrete but I was pleasantly surprised that no noise or scraping sound occurred. After we got on the taxiway my instructor said, ""Don't worry, I'm sure it'll be fine"". We proceeded to depart from Oshkosh and landed about 20 minutes away for a quick lunch. When I got out I inspected the nose wheel pant and immediately noticed significant damage on the bottom and to my horror I noticed that the strut appeared to have been bent down. Similar to if you would have stubbed your toe on a concrete curb. There was separation between the strut cover and then wheel pant cover of about 1 inch.So in hindsight, it appears that there was a lack of soil up against the concrete and I was the unfortunate airplane with wheel pants who ran into it while going back on the taxiway, like many of airplanes had done previously in the same spot. Did I have too much speed? If I went slower, would I have enough speed to get over the transition without getting stuck in the grass? Due to the tight rows, I couldn't have gone at a 45 degree angle. Obviously concrete is poured with into a form, unlike asphalt which is tapered off into the soil or grass. I asked my instructor what I could've done differently and he said ""I wouldn't have done anything differently and I don't think you could've done anything differently, it's just an unfortunate deal"". While his comments made me feel better for about 10 seconds, I'm still asking myself what could I have done to avoid it or change the outcome? Clearly next time I can request paid parking on the ramp, but what about the next crowded fly-in or pancake breakfast and I have to park on the grass?I flew the plane home and dropped it off at the shop and I'm not looking forward to the phone call and repair estimate next week. Yes-Im pissed about having the upcoming repair bill that I brought upon myself, but feel very fortunate to be in a position in which I own a beautiful aircraft and will ultimately be able to solve this problem. I think I'm most worried that it's going to get stuck in the shop I'm gonna have to cancel a few missions.Just wanted to share with us some of my other COPA friends and see what they have to say and to let them learn from my experience.",09:32:00,Monday

I recently parked next to a pair of them at Centennial on a hot day. I saw they had really neat supports to hold the oil door open on the top of the cowling to allow the heat to escape while parked on the ramp. I have often wanted to leave the door open, but the wind would blow it shut. The attached photos show what I ""reverse engineered"" from looking at the USAF SR20s. I made it from about $3 of materials from Home Depot. I needed about 30"" of small PVC pipe, two 90 degree elbows and about 24"" of foam pipe insulation. It works fantastic and minimizes the fuel line vaporization so common on the IO-550.",04:31:00,Thursday

Welcome to COPApedia as a Wiki,2,Spots of corrosion on elevator - where else?,https://www.cirruspilots.org/copa/member/sr_aircraft/w/copapedia/961.spots-of-corrosion-on-elevator-where-else.aspx,No, Jim Lewis,2018-01-02,0,"I've been watching a tiny (1/2"") bump under the paint on my r/h elevator horn by the silver screws for awhile, unsure exactly what it was. Recently figured out it's corrosion. In retrospect, it should have been obvious.I inspected the rest of the elevator yesterday and found four additional spots, all aft of, but right at the seam of the leading edge wrap. I've looked at historical posts and never determined what those folks did. Wondered if there was anything new. This is a 2006 -22, based in Portland, always hangared. Pictures attached.Question...did others' solutions involve; 1) spot treatment, 2) strip and repaint, or 3) de-rivet of the elevator leading edge? I've seen the Corrosion X mentioned, as well as ""fogging"" the inside of the elevator with a corrosion inhibitor? I've also seen mention of borescope inspection. Interestingly, I notice that the clear tape covering one of the access holes at the end of the stabilizer is missing. The annual was in August, but no idea how long it's been gone or if that's even a casual factor. Can I assume there are other spots on the plane? Flap fairings? I looked at the rudder and didn't see anything. Eager to hear if anybody has been through this recently...and if it's something you handled in the hangar or if the plane was down for a while getting ripped apart. (apologies for the rotated r/h stab shot...can't figure out how to rotate it here).What did you folks do? Did it go away or does it keep coming back?",03:31:00,Tuesday

Most insurers are selective about to whom they give such waivers. Some companies will offer a waiver of subrogation to a flight instructor who is giving instruction in the insured's airplane. It usually does not require that a fee be paid by the insured because the insured is obtaining additional training, however, some insurers will charge a fee.Subrogation is fairly rare. However, it has been noted in 2006 and 2007 that aviation insurers are much more likely to seek it than in the past, especially of renter pilots who damage flight school aircraft. The idea is to get the responsible party (or his/her insurance) to ultimately pay for a loss for which the insurer has already reimbursed the insured.The insured individual may never know about the subrogation, but it can be important. As the PIC during an accident, you would still need to mention the claim, but you could also explain the root cause of the accident and successful subrogation (thus likely diverting responsibility for that loss, and possibly a surcharge for loss history.)A flight instructor would be wise to carry coverage that insures him or her for liability and physical damage to airplanes in which he is training people.""",23:20:00,Thursday

While neither is particularly better or worse than the other, they are indeed different.The end result is that power will be lost when a consumer electronics device (with its 8 ohm standard) is plugged into the audio jack on your avionics panel (with its 600 ohm standard). And lost power equates to lower volume.ContentsA SolutionYes, you too can build one!Audio panel jumper modificationOther AlternativeA SolutionOne solution is to simply turn up the volume on your music device to compensate for the power loss. However, this is not an optimal solution as most audio devices have poor sound quality at high volume settings. In addition, this solution doesn?€?t actually address the problem, it simply avoids it. That means it?€?s not an acceptable solution for COPA members!Another solution is to construct a simple device that will convert consumer electronics impedance values to match the impedance value used by the avionics industry. The device sits in-line between your music device and the audio jack in the center console. This article describes how you can build the device.Multiple designs for an impedance matcher have been explored on the COPA forum. Some are more elegant than others, others are more durable, and a few are easier to build. The design presented in this article draws from the strengths of each of these approaches ?€? it is easy to construct, quite durable, and employs dual transformers for stereo sound.I chose to house the device in a small Radio Shack??? kit enclosure. The audio jacks fit securely into holes drilled in the enclosure walls, and the transformers are glued directly to the interior of the enclosure. The enclosure is small enough that the wire leads from the transformers will reach the appropriate connectors without any additional hardware.Yes, you too can build one!The first step is to mount the audio jacks. Use a 15/64-inch drill bit to drill a pair of holes into opposite sides of the enclosure (as shown in Figure A). Slide the audio jack through each hole, and fasten it down with the supplied collar.Next, mount the transformers. Apply crazy glue to the flat horizontal surface on the top of the transformer, turn the transformer upside down, and attach to the inside of the case. Repeat this step for the second transformer. Note that the red/white side on each transformer should point in the same direction. This will ensure that all the wire leads can reach the jacks. The most difficult task (and it?€?s not very hard) is connecting the wires from the transformers to the audio jacks. Consulting the schematic drawing will aid you in performing the next stage of the process.As shown in figure B: on the music player side, the white wire is common, so connect both white wires to the common lead on one jack. The common lead is the connector all by itself. Connect each red wire to a different connector on the same jack. It doesn?€?t matter which red wire gets connected to which lead, as long as the configuration is matched on the other side. On the plane side, the green wire is common, so connect both green wires to the common lead on the other jack. The two blue wires need to be connected to the remaining leads on the second jack. Make sure that the transformer that has the red wire connected to the bottom connector of one jack, is also the same transformer that has its blue wire connected to the bottom lead of the other jack. This will prevent the left and right channels from being swapped.Audio panel jumper modification==============================I looked up the installation manual (not the pilot manual) for the audio panel and found the way to do the mod to input audio from most real world audio sources. It's incredibly simple. No internal resistor change. Take the panel out using a hex wrench in the little tiny hole on front. Run a short insulated wire with 1/4 inch wire exposed on each end from plug 15 to plug 11 on the left hand (as you are looking at it from behind) pin connector (J2). Plug 15 is the very top left hole. Skip 3 holes to the right and the very next one is pin 11. You will have three empty holes between the jumper wire leads in other words. There are no corresponding male pins in the plane - side connector to cause trouble. Put the panel back in. I could do it in 2 minutes now that I know how to do it, and 1 3/4 minutes of that would be getting the panel in and out. The audio is perfect now. The impedance matcher I made is not needed now. I use a passive mixer in my console to input the audio from up to 4 different sources into the accessory port. It's faster to use this mixer to turn down my IPOD or Garmin 396 satellite audio than to use their own volume controls.Other AlternativesIf you?€?re thinking ?€?Great idea, but I?€?m not at peace with my soldering iron?€?, or you just don?€?t have the time ?€? you still have options. There are portable devices that are available commercially which can boost the signal. Both Radio Shack??? and Boostaroo?? make products that sell for $25 to $30. While these solutions are not for the audio purist, empirical tests from real users show no perceivable loss of sound quality. These solutions do have one slight drawback ?€? they require batteries.""",01:46:00,Sunday

Navigation accessories,3,"Garmin 396 mounting, installing, and wiring solutions",https://www.cirruspilots.org/copa/member/sr_aircraft/w/copapedia/522.garmin-396-mounting-installing-and-wiring-solutions.aspx,No, Peter Storer,2014-05-02,0,"IMPORTANT SAFETY NOTE If you are using a RAM suction mount on the windshield above the controls stick, please remove it immediately. There have been numerous reports on COPA of the mount coming off during critical phases of flight and falling on the stick. Very early in my use of the 396 I used a suction mount. On two different occasions the mount fell off on to the stick during takeoff. I know some members have had their suction mounts stay on for ever, but you really never know when it will fall off.Here's my solution, described in this thread. (Note: Thread no longer available /PS) However, I have made two significant improvements since this photo was taken.1) I mounted my XM antenna in the back window of the airplane. This reduces the weight of the assembly and I have had perfect coverage since the move.2) I changed to a G-Force suction cup mount. It is significantly better than the RAM that I previously used.I feel it is an almost perfect installation now. Stays put, easy to access and read, yet not in the way of anything.Here is a link(link is no longer available/PS)to a product I discussed in an earlier post of mine.. This is the only way to go, in my humble opinion.Last week I mounted my 396 as per turbo's (Bob Anderson) instructions using the Versa True mount. Robert Apenis and I bought 2 versa true kits as per turbo's specs. I removed the glare shield and placed the XM antenna (puck) on top of my (6-pack) alt pre-selector. I routed power and audio cables from the centre console to the left-front window. The result is a very stable mounting system that only takes a couple of hours to install.Just made my first test flight with my new Garmin GPSMap 396. Got it all wired up. It fit just fine in my VersaTrue mount that previously held my GPSMap 196. As I taxied out listening to XM Radio ""60's on 6"" playing Nights in White Satin a song by the Moody Blues, I just marveled at the technology contained in this little box.I had previously ordered the Power/data cable (bare wires) from Garmin.This cable has the power lead which I wired to a cig adapter, from there it goes into the 24 volt accessory plug I had installed under the seat. Cable also contains the stereo out leads which I wired to a stero plug and put the plug into the stereo plug in the center console. Later I plan to have it wired it up to the ADF button in the audio panel.Placement of the XM Weather antenna/receiver is critical to get good reception on northerly headings. It is important to have the antenna level in the aircraft, but that is made difficult by the slope of the glare shield. The antenna must be as far forward as possible to get good reception of the satellites on northerly headings over the rear of the aircraft.I fashioned a small wedge out of .020 aluminum then put Velcro on each surface.Next I placed the wedge as far foreword as possible over the defroster vent.Then I used some Velcro to stick the antenna on to the wedge.I am currently flying at 49N latitude which is the worst case for satellite reception on northerly headings in the US. I test flew the aircraft on a variety of northerly headings and maintained at least 3 bars of coverage on the satellites. I did intermittently have signal drop out of on descent (nose down) on northerly headings going in to land, but in cruise no problems.On my first flight I did not get audio terrain warnings even though the setup was right. Did get pop up windows warning of terrain. So I have to tract this bug down. Otherwise I am very impressed.I have been using WxWorx on a tablet for a year. Weather is easier to visualize on the big tablet screen using WxWorx, but all the weather available on the tablet is there on the 396, it is just a smaller picture.Here's what I've done, and it works very well and you can do it yourself.1. Propeller head suction mount GPS on windshield on the left.2. Hockey puck resting on glare shield just forward of GPS, on the left. Use folded washcloth, which I always put there anyway (to wipe windshield, sweat, etc.), to hide XM wire.3. Ran a ""right angle"" mini-plug adapter from audio output on Garmin so it points down rather than out from unit.4. Used plastic ties to bundle the audio cable and power cord, and added a power cord extension spliced and shortened to the right length. 5. Ran the bundled cables to the left of the pilot seat, then behind the pilot seat on the floor and ultimately connected in the mini-jack and power outlet in the console. 7. When I take off or descend and therefore want the terrain alerts un-muted, I plug the mini-plug that had gone into the console outlet directly into the mini-plug receptacle on my Clarity Aloft headsets. Mute the XM radio from the Garmin at the same time. With this, you have terrain advisories that won't be muted by ATC talk.",02:02:00,Friday
Safety accessories,3,JPI EDM-700 Installation,https://www.cirruspilots.org/copa/member/sr_aircraft/w/copapedia/819.jpi-edm-700-installation.aspx,No, Peter Storer,2014-05-02,0,"A few members over the years in their vintage aircraft have installed JPI-700 instruments in lieu of Engine Monitoring from ARNAV or EMax from the Avidyne equipped birds. Between the 12th and 13th I documented the installation of a JPI-700 in a 2000 vintage SR-20 with an ARNAV and 6-pack and highlighted the experience with video and still frame.All photos related to the installation can be found athttp://s145.photobucket.com/albums/r207/wolfala/JPI-700%20Install/For those who have ARNAV aircraft, don't want to spend $5,000 on the STC for an orphaned unit, or don't want to replace the ARNAV with an Avidyne and come out $20,000 poorer, or if you have an Avidyne and would rather not use EMax - this thread was made for you. I will post this discussion up in COPApedia when it is completed.The installation is an JP Instruments EDM-700 with fuel flow. The unit came with a fuel flow transducer, but in the aim of simplicity - we decided to piggy-back the signal off the existing fuel flow transducer so it would not affect the existing analog gauge and ease installation.The transducer itself is of the turbine type from Flowscan, and it sits in a hardened box at the rear of the engine compartment (circled in some color that my wife says is not red)You will need to crack this box open, which involves grinding off the top of 4 rivets, punching out their cores, and removing the black sealant around the box. The box will get mangled, but it can be popped back into shape afterwards. The goal is to read the K-factor off the transducer. The K-factor is essentially the number of pulses generated per second of rotation of the turbine wheel with the passage of fluid. Due to manufacturing differences, each transducer will have its own K-factor - so it is important to know the number ahead of time and not realize it is just a hot-swappable component. This number will be plugged into the JPI unit at a later time. Write the K-factor on the top of the hardened case with a black marker when you re-rivet it and reconnect the fuel lines to the unit.The next step was drilling the holes for the Exhaust Gas Temp probes. The existing hole for the single EGT was set to 3 inches from the bottom of the exhaust flange. For everything to be accurate, we would use that same value for all of the EGT probes to be drilled.Video #1The CHT probes were the normal screw-in type with a spring loaded action, so you would have to compress them and then turn to fit them in place. We used a thread sealant on the CHT probes (threads only) which contained copper and other properties - I just can't remember the name of the stuff. I believe its purpose was as an anti-seize in the event you needed to remove the probes.Video #2Perhaps the most daunting task was finding where to penetrate the firewall. This is where mechanics experience comes into play. Cirrus will not tell you anything on how to get through the firewall, and if you went to the vendors who hold the STC - the party line is ""we will have to work with the shop directly."" Well, lets save you the headache and tell you how to get through the firewall and cut through the bullshit.Remove the co-pilot seat, get on your hands and needs and go dive underneath the dash and down by the rudder peddles. To the left of the rudder peddles you will see a rather large (and thick) fiberglass PLUG - I can only describe it as a plug because it looks like a nuclear hardened flush-valve that came out of a government toilet. Unscrew this plug and you will expose a 3/8 inch bolt with the threads facing inward.Video #3That 3/8 inch bolt will have to be removed, which is a 2 man job - but first you need to locate it. Get back out of the aircraft and look to the lower-right of the battery box, and just to the 1:30 of the fuel pump. You will see a wad of RTV about the size of a quarter.Video #4Remove the RTV and it will expose a 3/8 bolt. Have 1 guy inside the aircraft removing the nut from the back of the bolt and another guy on the outside of the aircraft with a wrench holding that bolt steady. When the nut is off, you can remove the bolt and expose the 3/8 inch hole from which you will have to widen it to 3/4 inch. You will have to drill the hole to 3/4 inch on both the thin aluminum firewall, and the nuclear hardened plug.Video #5After both are widened, you will install a rubber grommet for the wires to pass through.The next step is figuring out where to put the instrument in the panel. The problem we ran into when we initially wanted to install it in the existing CHT/EGT instrument location was the unit was simply too damn long. It would not leave any room for the wire-harnesses at the rear of the JPI without bumping into the headliner. If we had kept it in the top-spot, we would've had to cut out part of the existing dashboard, which seemed a bit draconian.The solution was to swap the Oil Temp/Oil Pressure instrument, place it next to the Tachometer, and there would be no interference with the headliner of the panel.After that, its just a matter of routing the wires through the firewall, drilling 2 holes for the buttons of the JPI using a supplied instrument template, getting the cables hooked up properly, and you are in business. All said, the installation was 14 hours.Video #6",05:18:00,Friday
Safety accessories,3,Stall warning voice alert,https://www.cirruspilots.org/copa/member/sr_aircraft/w/copapedia/stall-warning-voice-alert.aspx,No, Eharrison,2013-08-17,1,"Stall Warning Voice AlertSome pilots suffer from a hearing loss which prevents them from hearing the stall warning horn.  There are two aids to assist with this problem.  One is visual; an installed light is activated in the cockpit when the stall warning system is activated, and the other is auditory providing a voice alert delivered through your head set.  An example of a voice alert system is the Voice Alert from Aircraft Components, Inc (ACI),  www.flyingsafer.com/. Lancaster Avionics at KLNS in Pennsylvania installed the system for at least one COPA member. Following is their description of this system.While not a true independent gear/stall warning system, ACI?€?s Voice Alert uses the pre-existing sensors already in place in your aircraft (which currently sound your existing gear horn) to trigger instantly recognizable voice warnings directly into your headset in companion with, and whenever your OEM stock stall or gear horn sounds.  While it isn?€?t a ""stand alone"" system and thus doesn?€?t offer the measure of safety as either the P2 or ACI?€?s 2037 Gear Alert System, we think this is an order of magnitude superior to the simple ineffective monotone horn that were placed in the cockpit where they would sound for everyone in the airplane to hear. Studies show that times have changed as today most pilots wear headsets which block out much of the sound from the cabin, making it more difficult to hear the warning horns mounted in the aircraft. In fact, we find Active Noise Reduction (ANR) headsets are designed specifically to block out the background cabin sounds including the warning horns which must be heard.At $495, the economical Voice Alert?€?s audio warning is piped directly into your headsets and over the cabin speaker whenever the existing stall horn sounds.  So with it installed, the pilot will hear the instantly recognizable voice message ""STALL, STALL"" from the built in speaker, and directly in his headset and if the gear warning horn sounds, the pilot will hear the voice message ""CHECK LANDING GEAR, CHECK LANDING GEAR"" alerting of the problem. Thus there will be no more confusion over which horn is sounding as these voice messages are in addition to the original gear/stall warning horn sounds.The Voice Alert consists of a small electronic unit about 2 1/2 inch by 3 1/2 inch in size that can be mounted almost anywhere in the cockpit. The installed weight of the unit is less than 1 lb. The unit is supplied as a complete kit consisting of the electronic unit, a pre-wired cable assembly, and all the connecters and mounting hardware. The only other item required is a 1 amp fuse or circuit breaker. Installation is easy, and can be preformed by an A&P mechanic of an avionics shop in a day or less.User Note:  Due to the fact the simpler/cheaper Voice Alert DOES depend on your pre-existing aircraft sensors and micro switches and is in essence just an extra or ""repeater"" audio warning system, it is NOT generally to be considered as foolproof as either of the totally independent stand alone systems such as the P2 or ACI?€?s 2037 Gear Alert System. However to be blunt, if you don?€?t spring for one of the other units, at $495 there is absolutely no excuse not to have this audio warning technology in your aircraft today if you suffer a relevant hearing loss...MOA Price:                  $495 Free Freight Average Install:      5-7+/- hrs Original article contributed by Ira Hamburg.",00:18:00,Saturday

""What's in YOUR survival vest?"" Those lads probably knew a thing or two about survival.I've become far more aware of the need to be a ""Pilot Boy Scout"" - to Be Prepared - since I began learning from Doug Ritter and did some field survival training. As a result, I carry a decent amount of gear in the back seat of the airplane (or, on rare occasions when all four seats are filled, in the baggage compartment). That backpack contains an assortment of stuff that reflects tons of thought and dialog between Doug and me - but mostly, it reflects Doug's amazing expertise.I know that the only stuff I can COUNT on having after a crash is what I have ON me when I exit the airplane. The rest may burn (or sink, etc.)Accordingly, I assembled a small subset of ""must have"" items that I tried to stuff into my pockets prior to each flight. I began wearing only cargo pants for flying - for the many pockets. But loading and unloading all the stuff was a pain, and leaving it in the pockets wasn't a viable alternative (if you try walking around with that much stuff in the pockets, you'll understand). I tried putting everything in a fanny-pack - but deemed it a safety hazard, because the first time I tried to exit the airplane with it on, it snagged on the seatbelt. Besides, the ""one big pocket"" style makes it tough to find things.I've settled on a fishing vest - it's perfect. Here's what's in it:1 - Ultralight Adventure Medical kit .32 - Whistle3 - RSK-MK1 folding knife4 - Spare prescription glasses5 - Storm Shelter / Pocket tent 6 - Pocket Survival Pack*7 - Aquafix Personal Locator Beacon8 - LED flashlight9 - Handheld Radio & accessoriesa bit controversial: I've taped a cigarette lighter to the outside of the pack, having weighed its ease-of-use against the downside of having butane on me in a fire.Some items, like the spare glasses and handheld radio, might be needed in flight - they're easy to access. The most important items are attached to the vest with a lanyard.Here's the vest, fully stuffed and stored on the backrest of my seat.

Many COPA members seem to really struggle with getting images into their posts. Placing images into posts is very easy. There are two image sources normally available to COPA members for publishing into a forum post: local images on your computer and images found during browsing the internet and available in your browser window.Images on Your ComputerImages typically found on your computer are normally placed there after being downloaded from a digital camera. For purposes of this discussion we will assume you are capable of getting images from your camera into a folder somewhere on your computer.Images on the WebDuring the course of browsing the web you will find images that you desire to share in a COPA post. Those images will typically have a web address (URL) which is specific to the image. This address will be needed to post the image into a post. More detail on that below.[edit]Posting Images from the Web BrowserThe easiest way to post one or more images into a post is to use images already available on the internet. For example, point your browser to a web page of interest, such ashttp://adds.aviationweather.noaa.gov, then go to the satellite page. Pick a satellite image of interest. When the satellite image comes up place your cursor over the image, then right-click your mouse button. A menu will show up, then move your cursor down to the ""Properties"" selection and hit the left mouse button. Up will pop this window.Now place your mouse over the the URL address field, hold down the left mouse key and drag the mouse down and to the right until the entire URL is highlighted. Make sure you drag down and to the right because some URL's are longer than the two lines visible in the Address (URL) box.Once the URL is highlighted then press the right mouse button and select ""Copy"". This will save the URL on your computer's clipboard.Next go to your post on the COPA forum. In the body of your post (before, in the middle or at the end of the text) type in the image tags [image] and [/image] then place your cursor between the image tags and right click your mouse, then select ""Paste"". Here is what you should see.Now when you post this message on COPA, the COPA server will go out to the ADDS server and render the current ADDS image inside the post you just created. The image you linked to will not be stored on the COPA server, instead every time your post is viewed the COPA server will refresh the image from the ADDS server. You can post as many images from a remote server as you desire in any post. There is no limit. Just keep adding[image]&[/image] tags with the appropriate URL pasted in between.[edit]COPA Forum Post Software Local Image Storage and PostingIn order to place an image into a COPA forum post a web address (URL ie http://www.turbopilot.com/copa/image3/mike.jpg) will be needed. The COPA Forum software allows you to upload one image per post. As some of you know this can be quite a constraint if you want to post more than one image. When you up load an image from a post you must find that image URL, then go back and edit the post to place the image URL between the [image]http...[/image] tags. It also presents image management problems since you have to go back to the original post to find the image URL for us in another post. This process is explained on the COPA forum. I really don't like this method of image display, so the reader is on their own here[edit]Image Placement into a COPA Post When the Image is Located on Your ComputerEvery COPA member should own a digital camera. When an aircraft problem comes up and you want help, a digital image will bring you the most help. In many cases an image will show the problem much better than you can by typing it out. Every digital camera will give you instructions about how to import your images from the camera into a folder on your computer. We will assume you have mastered this task for the following discussion.So the image or images you want to post are on your computer. Now you want to post those images on COPA. You have two problems to overcome: image size and getting an image URL on an outside server. These problems are easily solved with a great free service calledImageShack.WithImageShackyou can upload an image from your computer, resize that image, store it onImageShack, then obtain a URL to be used inside the [image] and [/image] tags in your COPA post. If you register withImageShackyou can also manage your images in an album, so that they are available for future reference. You do not have to register to upload an image, resize the image and obtain a URL for the image. Here is how you do it.From theImageShackweb site make sure ""File"" is checked next to the word ""upload"", then click the ""Browse"" button and navigate to the folder holding your images from the digital camera. The screen will look like this.Next click the ""resize image?"" box and select an image size to be used in your COPA posts. Most images from digital cameras are far too large to be posted on COPA. Posting oversize images on COPA makes the post unreadable, please limit your COPA images to a width of 800 pixels or less. In this example, I want to post a smaller image on COPA, so I selected ""320x240 (for websites and email)"".Now hit the ""host it!"" button and you will see the following screen.When you hit the ""host it!"" button your image will be uploaded to ImageShack and resized to fit on COPA. You will be presented will nine lines of code around the sponsor ads that pay forImageShack.Each of these lines represent different formatted URL's of the image to be placed in a variety of software for display. Unfortunately,ImageShackdoes not offer an image URL totaly compatible with the COPA forum, so you will need to pick the last line titled ""Direct link to image"". Highlight the address, in this case the address is http://img263.imageshack.us/img263/5694/mikeha8.jpg. Just hold down your left mouse button and drag your cursor across the URL address http://img263.imageshack.us/img263/5694/mikeha8.jpg, then ""right click"" your mouse and select ""Copy"". The URL of your resized, uploaded image is now stored on your computer clipboard.Next go to your post on COPA and type in the image tags: [image] & [/image] into your post. Then place your cursor between the tags, ""right click"" your mouse and select ""Paste"". Your post should look like this.You can place text before or after your image tags and you can also add additional image tags to post more pictures in the post.

It was developed with inspiration from the Bonanza Pilot Proficiency Program (BPPP) by Robert Price in 2003. As of February 2007 over 700 pilots have attended the training. It is targeted as advanced annual refresher training for COPA Pilots, and is generally held on a weekend. Current information about the program is available here:CPPP course details.The primary objective of CPPPis to enable pilots to operate their aircraft with greater confidence, safety and enjoyment. Safety comes from many facets of a pilot's knowledge base; including plane handling, weather knowledge and utilizing the advanced avionics the COPA Pilot has available. As pilots we get satisfaction from executing a text book approach and take pride after a smooth landing. Most of us review our performance after every flight. Nonetheless, the safety performance of SR2x pilots to date has not met our high expectations and the inherent safety advantages of the aircraft are not being realized. We hope that CPPP will help us all be safer pilots!In addition, we hope that CPPP will helplower insurance costsfor our members. As we all know, the cost of insuring our SR2x aircraft has been a major component of our total operating costs. COPA/CPPP has met with major underwriters to discuss the CPPP, SR2x aircraft in general, and provide demonstration flights; these efforts have been well received by the underwriters. In addition, we have sought some form of formal discount program for CPPP participation; to date, these efforts have been unsuccessful. However, several of the underwriters have indicated that participation in recurrent training in general is likely to influence their assessment of pilot-specific risk and, therefore, may lead to a lower individual premium. Participants are encouraged to include information on CPPP attendance at the time their broker renews their insurance policy.""",02:11:00,Monday

The primary purpose of COPApedia is to facilitate the collection and dissemination of information to help COPA pilots operate and enjoy their aircraft safely and knowledgably. COPApedia uses ""wiki"" technology, similar to Wikipedia, the popular user-edited web-based encyclopedia.ContentsCore Principles of COPApedia:COPApedia GuidelinesHow It WorksBenefitsQuestions and AnswersCore Principles of COPApedia:COPApedia is all about helping Cirrus Owners and Pilots to more safely and knowledgably operate and enjoy Cirrus aircraft.COPApedia articles should have a neutral point of view, which means we strive for articles which present all relevant points of view on a topic where applicable. Articles should not advocate a particular single point of view on a topic, rather, articles should present multiple points of view where appropriate; presenting each point of view accurately; providing context for any given point of view, so that readers understand whose view the point represents; and presenting no one point of view as ""the truth"" or ""the best view"". It means citing verifiable, authoritative sources whenever possible, especially on controversial topics.COPApedia content may be edited by any COPA member. Following the Wikipedia example, our belief is that over time, well meaning and thoughtful people will reach consensus to deliver articles which are truthful, informative and represent a neutral point of view. All COPA members should know that if you don't want your material to be edited mercilessly or redistributed by others, do not submit it to the COPApedia.Generally, the COPApedia collaboration and discussion process will determine the final content of COPApedia articles. In rare situations, COPApedia ""category mediators"" will intervene to help assure COPApedia articles remain truthful, informative and represent a neutral point of view.By contributing to COPApedia you give rights to use of your contribution to the Cirrus Owners and Pilots Association and you release all rights to your contribution. Your contribution may be freely changed, deleted, edited, and distributed in any manner COPA chooses. articles will only be directly available to members of the Cirrus Owners and Pilots Association.COPApedia GuidelinesArticles should be classified by Category and Subcategory to assist with navigation and searches.The ""naming"" of an article should generally be in ""Adjective Noun"" format. Names should be kept as simple as possible, such as ""Garmin X96 mount"" or ""Oil change"" or ""Mountain flying"" or ""Inflight icing."" See Article naming conventions.Articles should ""stand on their own."" While links to external references are appropriate, a particular article should not rely on external content to make it complete.Articles should not contain off topic material, political statements, commercial solcitations or advertisements or inappropirate racial, sexual, religious, ethnic references. Stay on topic and be nice.How It WorksCOPApedia consists of ""articles"" on a wide range of topics, all of which will focus on the safe and knowledgeable operation of Cirrus aircraft. The creation of these articles is accomplished using wiki technology, similar to the highly popular Wikipedia web-based encyclopedia (www.wikipedia.org). Wiki technology allows all COPA members access rights to create and edit articles. The Wikipedia experience has shown that through the collective efforts of thoughtful and knowledgeable people, it is possible to create remarkably valuable content with little ""paid"" staff time.BenefitsCOPApedia provides an easy to use, searchable web site for COPA members to quickly find information relevant to safely and knowledgably operate Cirrus aircraft. While a great deal of this information already exists in various forms within COPA, Wikipedia is advantaged in several ways:Articles synthesize content and various points of view. COPA members will not need to search through hundreds of forum posts to find relevant content. Instead, they will be able to quickly navigate to relevant COPApedia articles to find the information for which they are looking. Any member can add to or edit articles to improve the material.Articles present a neutral point of view on topics. The passion of COPA members regarding a particular point on view on a topic is frequently seen on the forums. By contrast, COPApedia is designed to present readers with a neutral point of view which fairly presents alternative perspectives on controversial topics.COPApedia is ""all content all the time"". While many COPA members enjoy the give and take interaction of the forums, others just want ""the facts."" COPApedia presents content in a factual manner, and leaves the repartee of the COPA forums behind. This approach to content delivery will appeal greatly to COPA members who just don't have the time or inclination to wade through forum content.Questions and Answers1. How COPApedia is moderated?COPApedia is not moderated per se. Designated member ""sysop"" volunteers will monitor article content. Wiki technology provides a discussion thread for each article to capture the debate about content. In what we expect to be rare circumstances, the sysop may need to arbitrate, or worst case, mediate content disputes. Wikipedia's experience in this regard is instructive. Generally, content only improves and the ""neutral point of view"" prevails over time. In extreme cases, the COPA board may be called upon to arbitrate a content dispute. Ultimately, content can be locked down from further edits.2. Who will moderate COPApedia?Per the wiki experience, the COPA community will moderate the content and organization. We expect that volunteers will be established by portal / subject area to review a collection of articles, and, who, of course, will be empowered like all COPA member to edit any COPApedia article.3. What is available for the public to see, versus members?Initially, COPApedia content will be exclusively available to COPA members. The COPA board may elect to release COPApedia content in various forms to further promote the COPA mission.More information regarding COPApedia and wiki technology in general is available in the COPApedia:About article.",02:35:00,Monday

Besides the primary goal of promoting safety, completion of the program may lower insurance rates or gain access to better insurance coverage for participating pilots. The first course was in April, 2002; several sessions are offered each year at various locations around the USA.COPA-TAN:Another safety initiative is the COPA Transportation and Accomodation Network (COPA-TAN). This program solicits volunteers from the COPA membership. Each volunteer is available to help provide transportation or accomodation to other COPA members who may be stuck away from home due to weather or maintenance issues. Our hope is that by having a ready list of members willing to help, a pilot will be more willing to consider staying on the ground, rather than risk a flight in marginal circumstances.Membership Directory:A directory of members, containing contact information for COPA members, will be published.

If articles and other additional information are available on-line, they will be linked.Weather Pages:As part of the development of the CPPP Weather segment, a set of Weather briefing pages was implemented that contain links to ""best of breed"" weather products available on the internet. Use of these weather pages should provide the pilot with a more complete weather briefing than is available from Flight Service or any individual weather site. The Weather pages include links to weather products not normally discussed during private or instrument ground school; however, most of these products are covered in the CPPP Weather segment. To help pilots document their pre-flight weather briefing, access to the Weather pages and the related weather products is automatically logged and retained for one year.Ride Share Board:COPA Members can post ride requests (and ride offers) to help ferry each other to service centers, fly-ins, or other events.Software Database:COPA provides a single source for information on the current software versions for Cirrus's avionics. Now to determine if you have the latest, greatest, and safest software version for your Garmins, ARNAV, or Sandel, just look us up. COPA tracks the latest software releases for these ""black boxes"" and posts the latest version numbers on our web site. Of course, you'll need to obtain the software itself from the manufacturer, but at least you are able to tell if your software is up to date.COPA Response!A team of technical liaisons and medical experts who are dedicated to researching issues of concern to our membership.

Airframe maintenance,3,Aileron trim test,https://www.cirruspilots.org/copa/member/sr_aircraft/w/copapedia/aileron-trim-test.aspx,No, Eharrison,2013-08-16,0,"""The Aileron roll trim tab test can determine if Aileron trim tab needs to be adjusted.rMis-set Aileron trim can cause wingtip rocking while under Autopilot.The test: At cruise speed, with the auto-pilot off,rTrim airplane for straight & level and hold that position.Insert FULL aileron trim in one direction while holding the wings level, and then let go and measure how long it takes to reach a 30 degree bank.Re-establish straight & level, and repeat step 2 for the opposite direction.

If it is off by more than a half-second, the roll trim tab needs to be adjusted.rThis procedure will tell you if the roll trim tab is mis-set.Member CommentsThe wiggly-wing was a hot topic a couple of years ago. One possible cause with a cheap fix is that your aileron trim tab needs to be adjusted. To see if this is so, do an in-flight test. At cruise speed, with the auto-pilot off, put in full aileron trim in one direction while holding the wings level. Release the controls and note the time it takes to roll 30 degrees by counting potatoes. Repeat in the other direction. If it is faster in one direction than the other (by half a potato or more, I'd say), the tab needs to be adjusted. If it is slower rolling to the right, have your favorite SC bend the tab (located on the right aileron) down a couple of degrees. If it is slower rolling left, bend the tab up. This procedure is in the AMM somewhere -- you might want to double check me. You may need to do this a couple of times to get it right. I would try this first, before replacing parts, as it should be the cheapest thing to try.""",21:48:00,Friday
Airframe maintenance,3,Autopilot troubleshooting,https://www.cirruspilots.org/copa/member/sr_aircraft/w/copapedia/347.autopilot-troubleshooting.aspx,No, Alexis von Croy,2015-05-10,0,"One common type of post that appears on the COPA forums is ""My autopilot does ________ when I do ______. What's a quick solution?"" Often this kind of post is answered with members suggesting ""Mine was fixed by bending the trim tab"" or ""Have your shop adjust the ______"" or ""You need to replace the _____"".The autopilot is one of the most complex systems in the airplane. It involves electronics, the mechanical components of the flight controls and rigging, and electrical actuators to apply force to the flight controls.Pitch trim problemsPitch Trim 101: There are two trimming devices.A Pitch Motor located in the tail controls gross trim adjustments by changing the levers in the tail.A Pitch Servo under the rear baggage area does fine tuning by tugging on the control cables. These work together. The Servo has pressure sensors that say to the computer 'I need More'. It gets more by turning on the pitch motor. If the motor does not relieve the pressure in a few seconds then a audio beeping is heard and a flashing trim with arrow is displayed until the pressure is reduced.Pitch Motor failure occurs if the motor will not operate or if the motor will not operate at a low startup voltage. When we hit the hat switch for manual trim we bypass the AP computer and give it full power which makes the motor move fast. In AP mode the AP ramps up the voltage to get the desired affect. If the motor starts late it can cause a delay and shows up as an error or other flight problems. When both devises work right the plane get completely trimmed so when you release the AP you have no stick pressure or jerk.The AP computer can make the motor look bad. In my case my computer had a blown fuse in the motor drive circuit. Replacing the fuse did not cure the problem as the drive transistor was fried too.Testing: Try reseating the AP. You can do a ground check to see if the AP is driving the Pitch Motor in the tail. Without starting the engine activate the AP and set it for a climb or decent (open door). The pitch servo will move the stick, thats normal. Fight the stick while it's moving to see (hear) the motor running in the tail. What you are doing is exceeding the pressure switch in the servo to tell the computer to activate the Pitch Motor.You can hear the same motor by hitting the hat switch but remember you are checking the AP. Don't confuse the sound of the Aileron trim cartridge in the wing with the tail. Your shop may be able to open the AP and check the fuse. The fuse could be good and the drive circuit could still be bad. Voltage checks can be done easily as there is an access panel in the tail under the elevator. There is also a relay that switches between the AP computer and the manual hat switch that can fail. Change or swap this relay to check it.Autopilot roll oscillation (wiggly stick)This is very common in Cirri, but not normal. Before you worry, check a few things:Is your rudder exactly centered with the airplane on the ground (look at the forward end of the rudder cap). (It should be within 0.1"")Were you flying with more than a 10 gallon imbalance between the tanks at the time? (If not, try again with balanced fuel.)Is the ""ball"" centered exactly in normal cruise flight? (if not, you probably have a rigging problem)Any of the above can contribute to a roll oscillation.Also perform the simple Aileron trim test which is:Trim airplane for straight & level and hold that position.Insert FULL aileron trim in one direction and then let go and measure how long it takes to reach a 30 degree bank.Re-establish straight & level, and repeat step 2 for the opposite direction. If the roll trim is perfect, the two times are the same. A small difference is OK.This procedure will tell you if the roll trim tab is mis-set. Do not, however, adjust the trim tab unless you answered questions 1 and 2 correctly.General recommendationsAutopilot troubleshooting is very complex. Don't let anyone ""tweak"" with the airplane unless they are following the Cirrus autopilot troubleshooting checklist.Don't get caught up in the ""maybe it's the _______"" game. Don't ""try"" replacing the _______ because someone else reported that worked for them. Don't try to point your shop in the right direction. (If the shop needs YOUR help, they're in over their heads!) Cirrus has published a detailed autopilot troubleshooting guide. There is a reason the autopilot troubleshooting documentation is 48 pages long - this is a tough job.The reality is that the autopilot is a very complex system that needs a highly skilled and disciplined approach to troubleshooting. Many Cirrus Service Centers simply don't have the ability to do this - even though they are quite capable of competently replacing parts and fixing less complex problems.It's very important that you take a by-the-book approach to solving your autopilot problem. If your SC/avionics shop has already gone through the entire troubleshooting procedure and come to a dead end, they should get Cirrus involved. If they have not, they are wasting your time and money.If your aircraft is still under warranty, your SC needs to get Cirrus approval for going through your aircraft step-by-step until they find the problem and fix it. Under warranty. Do not assume Cirrus will pay for ""trying"" things based on your suggestion unless they approve ahead of time.You just need a shop that has the willingness to RTFM (Read The Freaking Manual) and capability to do the work. If that's not the shop you are using, Cirrus can point you to one that can.A/P Disconnects (DFC90)Autopilot disconnects in cruise flight are very often caused by worn out servos, typically the roll servo. If the start-up voltage for the servo is higher than 2.2 Volts the DFC90 autopilot will not work properly in many cases. The roll servo will have to be changed.Remove left wingtip, attach to wing structure with zip ties (this way you do not have to open all electrical connections)Remove left aileronRemove inspection cover in front of left aiileronRemove and replace roll servoThis work should be done by an experienced A/P, because the correct installation of both the servo and the aileron (safety wires) is critical.",15:57:00,Sunday

Airframe maintenance,3,Cirrus paint care,https://www.cirruspilots.org/copa/member/sr_aircraft/w/copapedia/349.cirrus-paint-care.aspx,No, Roger Whittier,2014-05-19,0,"Our birds are painted with just about the most durable chemical resistant type of paint there is; a two part polyurethane. The brand used by Cirrus is PPG although it really is not important. Two part polyurethanes are incredibly durable and resistant to almost anything except MEK and toluene.The weakness in the paint finish on the Cirrus is the process Cirrus employs as SOP after the plane has been sprayed.Within a few days to a few weeks, the upper side of many if not most of the planes are wet sanded, compounded with an abrasive rubbing compound and then polished with 3M Finesse, another finer compound.The problem is that this process removes the top most layer of the paint surface, the microscopically liquid smooth part that is left when paint flows out and cures undisturbed.Unsanded and uncompounded, polyurethanes simply do not need ANY wax or otherwise to protect them. A good polyurethane paint finsih will naturally bead water when it is clean. Our aircraft will flatten out and appear dull when water is applied.This process of abrasion is crudely derived from the old school practice of wet sanding and compounding out lacquer and simple enamel paints. In a properly applied polyurethane finish this is absolutely NOT necessary AND has significant negative implications.I have discussed this with Cirrus at the highest levels and they have a million reasons why they do this. They (correctly) say that the paint manufacturer ""allows"" wet sanding. However, again-in a properly applied paint job there is absolutely no need for sanding out and compouding.None.The stains we find so hard to clean are as a result of this wet sanding process creating tiny, microscopic scratches in the surface of the paint. These ""Finesse-sized"" micro scratches are three dimensional and expose more surface area to dirt/stain/contamination etc. The sides of these tiny little valleys are VERY difficult to clean as they are so small.As a result these valleys fill in with contaminants and are impossible to clean without abrading more of the paint away.The irony of this is that much of the loss of protection caused by this wet sanding process could be recovered by finishing with a high quality sealer/wax immediately after the Finesse stage, yet Cirrus is on record as specifically telling new owners NOT to wax their planes for fear of interfering with the curing of the fresh paint!Never mind that Cirrus themselves essentially destroys the natural finish of the fresh paint long before we could ever have a chance to ruin the paint job with some wax, such heavily catalyzed polyurethanes are locked up really, REALLY fast and wax WILL NOT HURT THEM .Not even within a couple of days!If anyone ruins their paint job with waxing it too soon, I'll personally repaint it myself!So, wax early and wax often! Just about anything will work. Personally, I like BAAM for cleaning and protecting the TKS panels, acrylics and avionics screens, Rejex as a paint protectant and whatever wax comes in the prettiest bottle and is on sale!Car wax is marketed a lot like fishing lures....",10:08:00,Monday
Airframe maintenance,3,Electrical system,https://www.cirruspilots.org/copa/member/sr_aircraft/w/copapedia/350.electrical-system.aspx,No, Alexis von Croy,2015-05-10,0,"The Cirrus electrical system is a 28-volt direct current system equipped with two alternators and two batteries. The system has multiple levels of redundancy to reduce the risk of a total electical system failure.ContentsComponentsPower GenerationPower DistributionNormal OperationsFailure ModesElectricity for DummiesBatteriesEMAXComponentsThe following are the major components of the Cirrus electrical system:Alternator #1 is the primary alternator for the Main Bus1 & 2 and Non Essential Bus. It charges Battery #1. This is a 60 Amp. Starting with serial number 1663 a 100 Amp alternator was installed to accomodate air conditioning.Alternator #2 provides power to the Essential Bus, Avionics Essential Bus and charges Battery #2. This is a 20 Amp alternator. THIS IS NOT A STANDBY SYSTEMBattery #1 is designed to be large enough to provide starting power and enough power to run aircraft systems for a short time. This battery can supply 240 watts of power.Battery #2 is designed to run the essential buss for a short time in case of failure. This smaller battery can only supply power to the essential bus, powering some of the avionics systems. This battery can supply 168 watts of power.MCU stands for Master Control Unit. This is the electrical power system?€?s brain. The alternators, batteries, starter, landing light, external power and power buss connect here. Inside the MCU are regulators for the alternators, relays that are activated by the power switches on the dash, sensors to show you what is happening (warning lights and amp meters) and the ballast transformer for the landing light. Starting with serial number 1663 the MC was moved from the (hot) engine compartment inside the cabin, also the MCU100 was replaced with the MCU130 at that point.Power GenerationAn alternator installed on Cirrus aircraft will not create power without an existing source of power. This may sound strange but there are no magnets in an alternator. Instead it has a field winding in the middle that rotates. This field winding is energized by a battery or external power source to create the affect of a magnet.The outer winding is really 3 separate windings. Each winding has its own set of diodes to rectify the power from a AC Voltage to a DC Voltage. The amount of DC voltage/power is directly affected by the magnetic field created by the inner field winding. The voltage sent to the field winding is adjusted by the regulator built into the Master Control Unit (MCU). The regulator is a solid state device that measures the alternator's output voltage. As the output voltage goes up the regulator decreases the field voltage. As the output voltage goes down the regulator increases the field voltage.The final output voltage of the Alternator will remain fairly stable at the set voltage. The Alternator must turn enough RPM's to generate the needed power for the load being applied. If the RPMs are inadequate then the voltage will decrease as the load increases. The regulator will limit the maximum voltage but will not be able to maintain the set voltage. This will not hurt the alternator or regulator.The main battery in the Cirrus is primarily used for starting the engine and providing the power source for the alternator. It of course provides limited power if the alternator should fail. It also provides a stabilizing affect on the output voltage of the alternator. It helps to provide a higher quality DC voltage free of AC artifacts created by the alternator.So if you have a problem, the usual alternator failures are: failed brushes, shorted or open diodes, bad windings, bad bearings and broken engine coupling. It will also fail if the field wire has no or low voltage, the cause could be the regulator or wiring issues. The battery and the output wires must all be in good condition or the regulator and MCU could be fooled. The MCU also controls the flow of power to the rest of the airplane so the alternator may produce power but cut off for other reasons.The theory for Alt 2 is the same. It has it's own battery and regulator in the MCU.Power DistributionThe distributing system is quite clever. The requirements for a nearly fail safe electrical system dictated the need to have an automatic and uninterrupted secondary power source. The Classic battery alternator regulator systems have not changed in decades. The likely hood of two such systems failing at the same time is extremely rare. Designers set up multiple buss bars to operate really important instruments for which we call essential and other buss bars to operate less important instruments. Within these busses they are further divided. The two very independent systems are isolated to avoid needing to throw a switch to turn them on. Diodes were employed to allow power to in effect, spill over into the other system if it should fail. This doubling up also gives the pilot some warning that a system has failed while he/she still has the use of needed instruments. The system was designed to give the pilot reasonable time to land the aircraft safely even in IMC. The system further provides the pilot the ability to turn off every system independently to reduce electrical load when failure occur.Normal OperationsWhen the aircraft's electrical system operates normally, the alternators provide power to all systems. The Batteries receive a charge to bring them to a fully charged state. Minor charging of the batteries continues as long as the alternators operate.Failure ModesNo or low alternator output - External Causes: broken or loose wires, bad regulator in the MCU, broken engine coupling, switch and relay failure in the MCU or instrument panel. Internal failures: Burned out brushes, windings, bearings or diodes.Starter not working - Low battery #1, bad starter or starter relay, loose or broken wires, bad starter switch. A slipping starter coupler can make a start look like a bad battery but if the coupler slips you can hear the slipping noise. It may be hard to hear with the electric fuel pump on. Open the door, leave the pump off and pull the breakers on your avionics so you have a quiet environment. If the prop stops and you hear something, then release the key and if it stops then that was the slipping drive adapter.Irregular voltage - One of the hardest problems to diagnose. Usually a part is failing or there is a loose connection.Static and noise in the Communication system. The noise must be isolated by turning off everything electrical. Things like strobe lights can create static. A bad alternator diode can cause a whine in the audio system. You can help your shop by isolation the cause.Smelling smoke? One of the most feared because of the risk of fire. The POH details emergency procedure so it will not be discussed. Smoke/smell is caused by a failing part that get hot. The part may be internal, inside a radio for example or it may be wire that is overloaded. Generally the wiring is protected by circuit breakers. Heat can also be caused by a loose connection which melts surrounding parts. Fortunately fires are rare. Usually one of several scenarios will take place when you smell smoke.1.A part failing gets hot then the heat melts the part and it can no longer generate the heat, smoke/smell stops.2. A wire becomes shorted and gets hot causing smoke/smell then trips the circuit breaker or it disintegrates breaking the short circuit and cools3. You turn off power quickly before the part melts down totally or a circuit breaker is tripped. Turning power back on may cause smoke/smell to resume.Electricity for DummiesThis description is ultra simple and therefore it does not cover everything. Think of electricity as water, the wires as pipes, the batteries as the water tanks, the alternators as the water pumps and the faucets of your sinks, showers, and sprinkler as your electrical systems that need power.Water is pumped into the water tanks to maintain an exact level in each tank. If the water pumps should fail the tanks will run dry depending upon how many faucets are open. The larger the tank (Bat #1) will supply more water than the smaller one (Bat #2). We have a dual pump (Alt #1 & 2) and tank system to supply the faucets. The larger tank is designed to be the main tank and supply most of the water normally, including water to start the plane.The special part of our system is that we prioritize which faucets will run dry first if the tank goes dry. To do this, the most important faucets that we call essential have two pipes to them.1. This essential group of faucets will normally receive it?€?s water from the smaller tank because it has slightly more pressure (voltage) than the larger tank. If water from the smaller tank runs out then the other pipe from the larger tank takes over automatically. In other words if only the smaller pump and tank runs dry (fails) then the essential group of faucets will still have water supplied by the larger tank.2. The other, non essential faucets which need more water then the essential ones, receive only one pipe from the larger tank only. These other faucets are grouped together and labeled as BUS 1, BUS 2 and Avionics but still share the water in the larger tank only. Since the non essential faucets have only one pipe from the larger water tank, if the this tank should run dry and fail then all the faucets in the non essential group will go dry.We can control how much water flows and limit this flow when a water pump fails by turning off faucets that are not essential. The manufacture has divided up and grouped what it calls essential and non essential. We however can make our own determination of what we need to be turned on or off. The manufactures group on non essential faucets will work as long as the tank has water in it. When it runs dry then only the essential group will work until it?€?s tank goes dry.We also have sensors to monitor the pumps and tanks to tell us what is working and what is not working. What we do not have is the ability to measure how long a tank will provide water should the pump fail. Since the key to both systems are the water pumps feeding the tanks, failure of either water pump will have different results. This knowledge will allow us to decide the course of action. Examples:1. The smaller pump (Alt #2) fails - All system will still continue to work.2. The larger pump (Alt #1) fails - The non essential system will work until the larger tank goes dry. Then only essential systems will work being supplied by Alt #2.3. If both pumps fail then all the systems will operate until the tanks goes dry.4. We may choose to disconnect a pump or a tank because it other problems like too much voltage or we are concerned about fire. The results are the same as if the pumps failed or the tank goes dry.The Volt Meter will tell you the voltage on the Essential BUS. The AMP Meter in the center BAT position will tell you if Bat #1 is charging or discharging. Setting the switch to Alt #1 or Alt #2 will show you the output of each alternator (it will not show negative). Normal is 28 Volts, BAT slightly above 0 (more after start), Alt #1 and Alt #2 above 0.A complete systems description is in Section 7 of the POHBatteriesBattery Description The Cirrus has two 28 Volt batteries. The main battery (BAT 1) that starts the aircraft is in the engine compartment attached to the firewall. Bat 1 is a 10 amp hour led acid battery similar to a car battery. This battery is designed to supply high current for starting the engine. The second battery is really two 12 volt sealed lead acid batteries wired in series to provide 24 Volts. This package provides 7 amp hours of power and is located behind the aft cabin bulkhead. The definition of a ?€?amp hour?€? is, the number of amps the battery will supply for one hour. A 10 amp hour battery could supply 10 amps for one hour or 5 amps for 2 hours or 1 amp for 10 hours.Battery care The life of your batteries depends upon several factors, many of which are out of your control. Factors are storage and operating temperatures, discharge cycles, deep discharges, water level and charge rates. You have the most influence over the deep discharges. If you let your battery go dead by sitting too long or draining it heavily, the life is severely impacted. It is highly recommended you use an external power source if you are not running the engine. Try to minimize battery usage at startup. The power consumption is about 12 Amps with all systems on, excluding strobes, all lights and intermittent things like transmitting on the radio. Your total battery capacity is 17 Amp hours which means the batteries can go dead in 85 minutes and that assumes the battery is new and fully charged. The main battery can be easily charged by removing the top cowling. Some owners that do not fly often will connect a charger to keep the battery toped off. Also see Battery 101Battery #2 warning This Battery should be replaced every two years. It is hard to tell when the battery is bad since Battery #1 starts the plane. Do it at the annual to save money.EMAXEMAX (if installed) & Interpeting Data with emax software written by Mike GlazerThe MDF records data points for all these fields: TIME LAT LON E1 E2 E3 E4 E5 E6 C1 C2 C3 C4 C5 C6 OILT OILP RPM OAT MAP FF USED AMP1 AMP2 AMPB MBUS EBUSThe last 5 fields (""AMP1"",""AMP2"",""AMPB"",""MBUS"",""EBUS"") are for the electrical system.AMP1 = Alternator 1 output current in ampsAMP2 = Alternator 2 output current in ampsAMPB = The plus and minus current of the charge and discharge in amps for battery #2MBUS = The Voltage on the Main Bus for the BAT1 systemEBUS = The Voltage on the Essential Bus for the BAT2 systemIn the EMAX program there are three action buttons: Amperage, Amperage B and Bus Voltages.Amperage button will show AMP1 & AMP2. This is the output of the alternators. Both should show power output when the engine is running. Normal for AMP1 is around 12-14 amps and higher initially while the battery is being recharged and higher if landing lights are on. Normal for AMP2 is around 3-6 amps and may be higher initially if the battery is low.Amperage B button will show the charging and discharging of Battery #2. Before the engine starts is sees a discharge. Even after the engine starts the RPM may not be high enough to produce a charge. During run up it should show a charge then at take off it will show a charge. As time passes the rate of charge will decline to just about 1 amp which is essentially a float charge on the battery.Bus Voltage button will show the Voltage of the Main Bus (ALT1) and Essential Bus (ALT2). These are the also the voltages displayed on the engine page of the MFD and Essential Bus will show on the round gauge. Initially EBUS & MBUS will be lower before take off. The EBUS will show just under 27 volts and the MBUS will show just over 27 volts. As RPM increases the alternators can now supply full power and the voltage reach their designed values. The POH says the MBUS is regulated at 28 volts and EBUS is regulated 28.75 volts. Your normal may be slightly different +/- .25 volts. You can expect deviations up to about .4 volts and see this jitter in the graph.Note: There is no official support for the EMAX program as it is an after market product. There are at least two programs for analying the data. A COPA member based in the UK, Mike Glazer, continually updates and improves his free (to COPA and LOPA members) Emax analyzer program. This program has a wide range of capabilities which are more fully explained in the article.Another program is EGView... excellent for generating a view of longer term trends (i.e. tracking over multiple flights). Not free; its owner, Dave Garing, is a COPA member and a super-nice guy who provides endless tech support at no charge.",15:41:00,Sunday
Airframe maintenance,3,External 24V battery,https://www.cirruspilots.org/copa/member/sr_aircraft/w/copapedia/351.external-24v-battery.aspx,No, Roger Whittier,2014-05-19,0,"To those who use external 24v batteries as a Ground Power Unit...There is a real danger here. Lead-acid batteries, such as the typical external car batteries used, as well as the BAT 1 that's installed in our aircraft, have a very low internal resistance. That means that any difference in voltage between the sets of batteries will result in a VERY high inrush current - essentially limited mostly by the resistance of the wiring between them. That current does the battery plates (in all the batteries involved) no good at all. In an extreme case, such as when the onboard BAT 1 was used for awhile with no external ""help"" and so is measurably depleted, the plates could buckle enough to cause an internal short, which at a minimum would destroy the battery and could even result in an explosion.Note that I said ""measurably depleted"", not ""substantially depleted"". A substantially depleted onboard battery is pretty much guaranteed to do bad things.It's for this reason that a real battery ""charger"" is better - it provides a higher voltage (typically around 28 volts), but limits the current to acceptable levels (usually the spec for the charger - 3A, 10A, 20A etc.)If you MUST use straight batteries, I suggest you use something to limit the inrush current - something in series with the battery. (A convenient place to connect this might be to use it in place of the ""jumper"" that connects the two 12v batteries to each other). What to use? Any high wattage, low resistance device will do the trick. One ohm will limit the maximum current to 24 Amps - pretty reasonable. If you have an old toaster, you can actually just unwind a few inches of element wire; or you can approximate the same resistance with a 50 watt low-voltage ""Malibu"" lawn light. Warning: If you use resistance wire, it is likely to get hot! (So would the Malibu light - but you'd see it glowing).All this said, I did use just such a system myself for awhile, until I realized what might happen. And FBOs the world over use power carts (like Power Bunny, and others) that are used almost exclusively to ""jump start"" airplanes with weak batteries - or to remedy situations where the Master switch was left on, etc. To my knowledge, they mostly work without obvious damage. They wouldn't have any current-limiter, because that's counter-productive if you're trying to start an engine - that requires momentary currents that may be in the 100's of amps. But there's no doubt that it does the airplane's battery no good at all.Could an external battery be used when the airplane's battery is reasonably fresh?In theory (i.e. perfect batteries, and a perfect cable interconnecting them), ANY difference in voltage would be enough to be very damaging. But just as our airplanes don't produce perfect lift, free of drag, so there is no such thing in electrical practice as perfect batteries, perfect wiring or perfect connections. So in practice, I'd say that anything more than about 1/2 volt of difference is.. (pun alert!) potentially dangerous. In the scenario you outlined, i.e. recently-flown airplane coupled to a battery cart, well... that depends. Has the battery cart itself just been charged? If so, it is quite likely at high enough voltage to cause trouble. If not, it's probably OK most of the time.The saving grace in most typical ""jump start"" scenarios is the resistance in the jumper cables. Paradoxically, cables that most would regard as ""good"" are nice and thick, very heavy, as short as practical for the application, and with very toothy, strong clips at the ends - i.e. everything possible to minimize their resistance. Take an absolutely dead car battery (that's in otherwise good condition!), connect it to a fully charged ""donor"" battery that is also in good condition via a ""good"" jumper cable such as I just described, and your chances of ruining both batteries are indeed excellent. In practice, it's normally the case that one of the following conditions prevails:1) One or other of the batteries isn't in terrific shape (usually the dead one - although, note that even a brand new battery can be dead); older batteries have higher internal resistance, which limits current.2) The jumper cable has enough internal resistance in it to limit the inrush current to a safe level;3) A connection made at one end or the other isn't the best, and the ""mistake"" adds resistance.Arguably, the BEST way to jump-start a car (or an airplane) is to use longer, thinner (i.e. not such ""good"") jumper cables to connect the donor to the dead vehicle. Such jumpers have enough resistance to ward off inrush current issues. Leave the engine in the donor vehicle running, so that its alternator charges the dead battery (it'll still charge, at a perfectly reasonable rate). After a reasonable time, like about 10 minutes, start the ""dead"" vehicle. Disconnecting the jumper first reduces the likelihood that you'll fry the alternator in the donor vehicle.So - will jumpstarting a car (or an airplane) kill the battery every time? No. Will it cause an explosion every time? No. Could it kill the battery or cause an explosion? Well, I just watched Fargo again, so the answer is... Ya, you betcha.Finally, does jumpstarting ever do either battery any good? No. Can it be done so that it minimizes risk/damage? Absolutely. See above.",10:03:00,Monday
Airframe maintenance,3,External 24V power,https://www.cirruspilots.org/copa/member/sr_aircraft/w/copapedia/352.external-24v-power.aspx,No, Roger Whittier,2014-05-19,0,"The Gill TSC-01V battery charger offered by the Cirrus Store only puts out 7.7A at 27V (and is $50 higher then the Schauer 20A model (TB20024-20A) from Aircraft Spruce). I would recommend a minimum of 10A if you want to play with avionics on the ground.The Gill has the same ""features"" as the Schauer in that it has circuit protection against reverse battery and shorts. (No voltage at output when not connected to battery). It is designed to be connected directly to the battery and would still require some sort of ""kick start"" as discussed in my write up to work as an external power source.If you have a friend or a TV repair shop (do they still repair TVs?), he/she could make the simple change to the Schauer unit.

Airframe maintenance,3,TKS fluid pouring,https://www.cirruspilots.org/copa/member/sr_aircraft/w/copapedia/355.tks-fluid-pouring.aspx,No, Roger Whittier,2014-05-19,0,"It seems that over time, several of us have tried a variety of ways to allow us to fill up the TKS tank, because simply pouring from a container (even into a funnel) gets unwieldy, and often results in an ""overflow situation"".My first attempt was this FloTool valve which I bought at Walmart.I've poured more TKS fluid outside the airplane than in the tank. I've tried all the solutions on this net, and found that modifying the 2-1/2 gal. bottle cap to include a spout works the best for me. (If you like refilling out of a one gallon bottle, then ignore this.) I modified the cap to include a 3"" long piece of 1/2"" PVC Sch. 40 pipe so I could refill the TKS tank directly from the bottle. Mike R. has one of these modified caps (and bottles) I sent him. Maybe someone can persuade him to post a picture and my parts list. Total build time: one hour.For those of you who (like me) pour from a 1 gallon bottle. Another nice feature of this approach is that you can squeeze the bottle to get the fluid out faster.My current approach to the problem is to use a Garden Sprayer: I unscrew and completely remove the tip of the spray nozzle for filling. It's a little slow, but it allows for a very precise fill (trigger control), with an excellent view into the filler neck because the nozzle itself is skinny. It has the additional advantage of doubling as a container for extra TKS fluid, and allowing me to use it to spray on frost-covered surfaces should that need arise.My solution was to buy a small drill powered pump from Menards for $3.99, attach some PVC to the input side of the pump and a short piece of clear tubing to the output end. I power this with a cordless drill. It works great. Once you have it filled, just reverse the drill to back the fluid column back into the TKS jug.This is a shot of the finished assembly.I notched the end of the input tube so the TKS fluid can flow when the tip is resting on the bottom of the jug.Here is another approach. A product called Petro Pump aka Han-D-Pump was attached to the cap of a TKS container. Operate the pump handle with one hand and hold the dispensing end in the other. If the light is good, you can observe the fluid level as you are filling and avoid spillage. The Petro Pump is available either with or without a container. The standalone Petro Pump can bepurchased on Amazon.",09:40:00,Monday
Airframe maintenance,3,Wing tip strobe replacement,https://www.cirruspilots.org/copa/member/sr_aircraft/w/copapedia/356.wing-tip-strobe-replacement.aspx,No, Roger Whittier,2014-05-19,0,"""The following procedure was provided by an SR22 owner to illustrate his experience with replacing a strobe. There are differing interpretations regarding what maintenance can be performed by an owner under Part 43. This article is not meant to take a postion on what is allowable or not. Rather, it is simply provided to share some detailed information about replacing a strobe.This procedure is for G1 and G2 airplanes (mine is s/n 0482). I think the later models are easier to replace because they added a connector closer to the strobe. You should have the Cirrus Airplane Maintenance Manual for reference, page 33-40 (Exterior Lighting). In my opinion, the technique detailed in the AMM seems to be impossible - in order to get the old flash tube out (or put the new one in) it seems you have to remove the entire nav light/strobe assembly by disconnecting the nav lights, strobe, and ground strap. The reason is there are so many tie wraps holding the ground strap in place around the nav light and strobe wire, there is no way to reach in the wing to even cut them, much less put them back once the new lamp is in. It also seems much safer to just pull the entire bundle and rebuild it so the flash wires are properly encased by the ground strap - something that would be very difficult to do otherwise. This is critical if you have a stormscope; if you don't do this right you can get phantom strikes from the strobes.Plan on at least an hour and a half the first time through this.  This isn't hard, but care should be taken.Getting Started You will need some tools:#2 Phillips head screwdriverflat head screwdriver (large tip)instrument screwdriver or pin removerDiagonal Cutters (wire cutters)And some supplies:40 wire ties (3 to 4 inch)A box or something to put screws in so they don't disappearYou might need some shrinkwrap insulation and a soldering iron to repair the recognition light wires ?€? they apparently can get hot and melt the insulation (see step 10 below)Finally, of course, you need a new strobe.  Whelen part number 36-0050705-00, the A600 flash tube assembly. This is the one with the long cable integrated in to the assembly; there is another A600 without the cable.The Process1) Verify which strobe needs replacing. (Don't ask.)2) Put a blanket or towel over the top of the wing, so that when you put the wing tip on top you don't scratch things up (also keeps tools from rolling off).3) Remove the the screws holding the wing tip to the wing. The tip shouldn't fall off ?€? there is an big lip around the edge, but brace it or have someone hold it anyway.4) Slide the wing tip off and flip it over so that it rests on the top of the wing.http://www.cirruspilots.org/cfs-filesystemfile.ashx/__key/CommunityServer.Components.UserFiles/00.00.00.39.11/strobe1.jpg5) If working on the left wing, be careful not to damage the pitot tube heat or ram air lines.http://www.cirruspilots.org/cfs-filesystemfile.ashx/__key/CommunityServer.Components.UserFiles/00.00.00.39.11/strobe2.jpg6) Disconnect the ground strap where it connects to the wing spar.http://www.cirruspilots.org/cfs-filesystemfile.ashx/__key/CommunityServer.Components.UserFiles/00.00.00.39.11/strobe3.jpgThe strobe connection is wrapped inside the ground strap. Disconnect it.http://www.cirruspilots.org/cfs-filesystemfile.ashx/__key/CommunityServer.Components.UserFiles/00.00.00.39.11/strobe4.jpg7) Remove the recognition light/strobe assembly by unscrewing it where it attaches to the wing tip. One of the screws attaching this assembly is hidden under the strobe bulb itself. Carefully pull the bulb aside in order to access the screw.8) You can now pull the strobe/light assembly and cable out from the wing tip.http://www.cirruspilots.org/cfs-filesystemfile.ashx/__key/CommunityServer.Components.UserFiles/00.00.00.39.11/strobe5.jpg9) Snip the wire ties and carefully unbraid the wire bundle.10) Unpin (or just cut off) the strobe molex connector, and pull the old strobe out of the strobe/light assembly. There is a small sticky cushion holding the strobe to the assembly. If you are careful this does not need to be replaced.11) Check the wires going to the big white bulb to see if they are melted. On mine they were melted and bare wire was showing; not good. If melted, you could tape, but the best solution is to put shrink wrap on them.http://www.cirruspilots.org/cfs-filesystemfile.ashx/__key/CommunityServer.Components.UserFiles/00.00.00.39.11/strobe6.jpg12) Unpin the new connector. There are special tools for this, but if you are careful you can just push in the small metal strip that sticks out of the pin to allow it to be pushed back. Be sure to push it back out before replacing the pin in the connector; otherwise, it can slip out. WRITE DOWN WHICH COLOR WIRE GOES IN WHICH HOLE!13) Feed the wire through the hole, reassemble the strobe/light assembly, and rebuild the connector, making sure the wires go in the correct holes (you did mark the connector or write it down, didn't you?).14) Re-wrap the ground strap. Do this carefully, making sure the strobe wires are completely enclosed by the ground strap, and making liberal use of wire ties to make sure it won't come apart. This is apparently a big potential source of stormscope noise.15) Feed the rebuilt cable back in to the wing tip and reattach the connectors. Clean the ground strap connection to the wing spar/ground point and reattach.16) Test the strobe, nav lights, and pitot heat (if left wing).17) Reattach wing tip.18) Make the log entry, with your name and certificate number.""",09:27:00,Monday
Avionics maintenance,3,Autopilot heading & course error adjustment,https://www.cirruspilots.org/copa/member/sr_aircraft/w/copapedia/358.autopilot-heading-course-error-adjustment.aspx,No, Peter Storer,2014-05-19,2,"The following applies to airplanes equipped with the S-Tec System 55X autopilot (AP) and the Sandel SN3308 horizontal situation indicator (HSI). It does not apply to PFD-equipped airplanes.AP adjustments clearly fall outside the definition of preventative maintenance, and therefore should be signed off by a qualified person before the aircraft is returned to service. They are presented here to help the owner help their avionics shop or service center. And, of course, the pilot must perform a thorough checkout of the autopilot and be satisfied with its performance before relying on it in IMC.Autopilot operating modesThe AP has three lateral modes: heading (HDG), navigation (NAV), and GPS steering (GPSS). In HDG mode the AP uses a signal from the HSI to steer the airplane to minimize the difference between the heading bug and the actual heading, as displayed on the HSI. In NAV mode the AP uses a signal from the HSI to steer the airplane to minimize the course deviation, as displayed by the needle on the HSI. In GPSS mode the AP uses a (digital) signal directly from the GPS receiver to steer the airplane to minimize the cross track error. GPSS is not affected by the HSI.There are two offset adjustments available for removing residual errors, the trimpot on the face of the AP and a setup parameter in the HSI. These, in general, allow two of the lateral modes to be made perfect with the residual error remaining in the third. The accepted application of this constraint is to make HDG and NAV perfect and to leave the residual error in GPSS. The rationale is that NAV mode is used for precision approaches while GPSS mode is used en route and for non-precision approaches. (At such time when GPSS is used for precision approaches this may be revisited.) The residual error in GPSS is small in any case.Ground adjustmentThe following steps are performed with the airplane on the ground and connected to an external power source.The trimpot on the AP has three turns. Center the trimpotEngage heading (HDG) and navigation (NAV) modes and verify that the AP operates as expected.Pull both beakers for the HSI and adjust the trimpot for zero roll trim motion in NAV mode. There is some (apparent) hysteresis, probably due to the integral part of the control law. This adjustment removes the course offset assuming the electrical offset from the HSI is zero.Reapply power to the HSI while holding down the SHIFT and A-B buttons. This puts the HSI in setup mode.Press the VUE button repeatedly to get to page 1, which is the normal operating page. Engage HDG mode and note the heading bug setting required for zero roll trim motion. Disengage the AP.Press the VUE button repeatedly to get to page 9, ""FCS CHANGE"".

Avionics maintenance,3,Avionics screen cleaning,https://www.cirruspilots.org/copa/member/sr_aircraft/w/copapedia/avionics-screen-cleaning.aspx,No, Eharrison,2013-08-16,0,"The key to cleaning your display screens is to ""do no harm"". Poor cleaning doesn't simply clean poorly, it permanently damages the surface by scratching it. A lot of clean screens are badly scratched by poorly done cleaning, while dirty screen (or lens) that can almost always be cleaned perfectly. In other words, if in doubt, don't mess with it. 2-4 times per year is more than enough if you keep your grubby fingers off the screen when you fly.The crud on your screen comes in two general types: (1) things that will dissolve (finger oil, sneezes, soft-drink spray) and (2) things that will scratch (dust, grit, dirt). You need to remove the stuff that scratches first.You wouldn't really rub your screen with sandpaper or a brillo pad, right? So why take a piece of grit that is stuck to it and vigorously rub the screen with it? You will do just that if you just take a cleaning cloth, press it into the dirt, and start rubbing the screen with it.So, the key thing is to VERY GENTLY remove the initial coating of dust and grit with a soft clean damp cloth, in a single SOFT wipe from edge-to-edge, while rolling the cloth to pick up the dust, not to slid it across the whole screen. This will remove 99% of what might scratch it.You will be left with some oily fingerprints or sticky spots. Use your choice of liquid/spray cleaner applied to a DIFFERENT soft cleaning cloth, and very gently clean this stuff. If you have a stubborn spot DON'T RUB AT IT REPEATEDLY !!!!! If you do, you may be looking at this spot for a long time. Moisten it and let it soak for a while, it should come right out.For the cleaning cloth, you can use the fleecy yellow thick microfibre cloths you can buy by the bagful at Costco; the grit gets caught in the fleece and is less likely to scratch. The thin, flat kind don't catch particles nearly as well, but they will do. Squares cut from a very clean soft old T-shirt work fine, too. Avoid any paper-type product. Don't even THINK about using a paper towel or shop towel on your screens, not ever. Throw the clean used cloths into a plastic bag and wash them alone in the laundry. Dirty ones are just like sandpaper.As far as the liquid cleaning solution, most products intended for eyeglasses or camera lenses works fine. Distilled water works pretty well, but the alcohol+water in typical solutions dries more readily and dissolves stuff a little better. Windex is acceptable in a pinch, but might be a bit harsh to use routinely. Don't use stuff designed for plexiglass (Plexus, etc.). If you use a spray product, don't spray the screen and allow liquid to leak down and around the bottom edge of the screen. Spray the cloth first, then wipe with it.Remember, you are trying to gently remove the foreign junk from your screen, not spread it around, so don't mop the the screen with the same 4 square inches of cleaning cloth, ""roll"" the crud into you cloth as you constantly turn it to an unused part.These screens cost hundreds (about $800) to replace - don't cheap out. Spend $20 on a pile of good microfibre cloths and keep them clean.",22:02:00,Friday

I will arrange to get it replaced and am wondering if it is a standard part (one a maintenance shop would have in stock) or needs to be special ordered from Cirrus.I believe that the PTT can be replaced by an Avionics shop with a 'PTF' (Positive Tactile Feedback) switch... one which provids a palpable 'click' when you press it. These generally also have a longer life-expectancy. I believe that most avionics shops will enter this as a ""minor change"" item.finally I gave up on Cirrus and took the matters in my own hands. I went to Radio Shack, bought a miniature momentary contact switch (for $1.49) and modified it to fit the yoke. It has been working perfectly since then (6 months).the newer planes have an improved PTT switch which is larger in diameter, has an indentation for your finger, and also has a ""click"" feel when depressed so you can sense on/off easier. Also, the newer planes have a separate autopilot disconnect switch located in the blank ""plug"" between the trim switch and the PTT switch.u2028My SN is 1904 and I still have the older switches. I think the new ones started somewhere around SN 2000 but I don't have the exact number. I really would like the newer switches, particularly the autopilot shutoff because my SR22's trim switch is particularly difficult to find the sweet spot to turn off the autopilot with one beep.u2028u2028My SC checked and the the new switches can be inserted in the older yokes. The switches are somewhere around $80 each and the labor is about 2 hours per yoke. You also need to replace the little top plate so the switches are labeled correctly -- I don't have a price on that plate yet. So the total job for both yokes should be somewhere in the range of $600-$750.",09:19:00,Monday

I called Avidyne and at the end of last year during their DFC9 sale and they offered to replace my MFD for newer one for $2,300 including new software. I thought this was fair and asked them to proceed, then I waited for a month to hear anything from them or the local Avidyne dealer and after repeated emails I then got the new price of $4,000 (plus shop time and reprogramming time) but this did not include an exchange so my plane would be down for at least 2 weeks. At this point my warranty had expired and so I was looking at a minimum of $1,300 for the screen replacement and another $500 for a 1 year warranty required to do the screen replacement. Nice work Avidyne... $1,800 for a new screen plus dealer labor and reprogramming, way to suck Cirrus owners dry.Happy ending: I called around to a lot of shops to see if there was a recoating procedure or something that I could do since the MFD itself was working just fine. One person I talked to suggested an Armor All cleaning wipe would take the coating off very effectively in about 10 minutes of rubbing and then if I put on an Aerotech glare shield, everything would be great. So this is exactly what I did and after about 25 minutes or work and $50, my screen once again looks pristine. Flying yesterday with direct sun on the MFD, I could see it better than ever before. If anyone else has this problem, I strongly suggest this course of action instead of dealing with Avidyne.Ed.Here is a picture of the wipes:Buy the screen protectors here. They have them for the PFD / MFD as well as for the Garmin 430's.Once you remove the anti-glare coating, you are left with a very smooth screen surface. You get very bad spectral reflections off the screen when in direct sunlight - I really couldn't see anything on the screen when the sun was shining on it. As soon as you put the screen protector on, it has a microscopic rough particulate surface that eliminates these spectral reflections. Huge difference. I actually think it is brighter now without the extra coating on the MFD with the screen protector on. It's hard for me to remember what it was like before the glare coating started failing (1-2 years ago) but it seems to be much better than it ever has been before - and for only about $50, not $1,800 from Avidyne with no screen protector!Ed.Wish we had a before picture. As you can see it is nearly flawless now - albeit a bit shiny. He has ordered a Aerotech screen and that will fix the shiny plus put a layer of protection on it. This just saved him a couple grand at Avidyne. Good suggestion Ed.""",00:47:00,Monday

If you wax, (as per the POH) make sure to use a silicone-free product. (If you prefer to outsource potentially time-consuming tasks like cleaning, you also have the option of using an aircraft detailer.)ContentsStandard washStubborn stainsWaxingPlexiglassAvoiding static port blockageStandard washMild soap dissolved in warm water works well for most dirt. Any common dishwashing detergent or Mr Clean works. The standard procedure is to:Wet down the surface and flush loose dirt with a hose.Liberally apply soap and water with a soft sponge or cloth.Allows stubborn stains to ""marinade"" for a few minutes.Rinse thoroughly. This is best done with a hose.Dry quickly with soft towels to minimize water spots. Cooler or humid weather helps too.Start by washing the top surfaces and work your way down, ending up with the belly. A mechanic's creeper (or dolly, used to roll under a car) is virtually a necessity for neck-pain-free belly-cleaning.An nifty wash-and-dry system is available from Mr. Clean.Stubborn stainsIn cases where soap and water don't suffice, such as oil-stains on the belly, COPA members report good results with Simple Green All Purpose cleaner.The non-bleach version of Scrubbing Bubbles is another favorite.More specialized products, such as BAAM and Wax Wash All, are also used for stain removal, though for cost reasons they are perhaps better left for post-flight ""debugging"".After reading many of the positive threads about using commercial ""claying"" systems, I tried two of them and found them cumbersome and basically worthless. Then with some experimentation I tried Mothers Pre-Wax Cleaner in liquid form(easier application) and violla, it worked like magic in removing truly stubborn stains embedded in the protective clear coat. I give this product a ***** recommendation.WaxingAn optional post-washing step, waxing, will preserve the paint on your Cirrus. Silicon-free wax should be polished on with a soft cloth or, better yet, chamois. Some swear by RejeX.The POH prohibits waxes with silicone, without explanation. From an earlier post by Mike Radonsky:Apparently, silicone migrates through paint over a long time; eventually getting between the paint and the, er, painted. Since it's a releasing agent, said paint can start flaking off. Aside from that, though, silicone really does a nice job of making things shine (it releases dirt, too), hence the temptation to use it. In the case of our airplanes, I imagine (but have NO data to support this) that the migration may take even longer through our epoxy based paints; and that it may not stop when it gets to the fiberglass underneath. If that's true, then it's easy to understand the restriction.PlexiglassWhen washing the plane, mild soap and water work well on the windshield, windows and other plexiglass surfaces. The key is to avoid abrading the plexiglass, so a soft touch is essential. As is avoiding circular wiping motions, which can groove the surface over time.For quicker cleaning, such as after a flight, products such as Plexus or Prist work well.Avoiding static port blockageWhen washing your plane, it makes sense to prevent water from getting into your static system. One simple way to do this is to put painters tape or masking tape over the static ports. IMPORTANT: Remove the tape when you are done washing the plane and absolutely before your next flight.",09:13:00,Monday

Then re-wipe with a second damp towel reserved for final-wipe only. Then go on to the next section. Even with a lot of bugs and an oily belly, the whole plane takes about two hours for one person to make it sparkling all over, one hour for two people. No hose, no drain, no wet floor, no muss or fuss. It's the only cleaning method I've used for 2 years. My teenagers have it down to a science, even using different colored towels for the first dirty wipe and the second clean wipe! They take four ""dirty-wipe"" damp towels and four ""clean-wipe"" damp towels to the hangar, and use one each for each wing, fuselage top & tail, and belly.I can tell you that I've used Wash and Wax Allalmost since day one, based on a pile of discussion on the forum, and others you can find with the Search function. Supposedly, it contains nothing harmful to our finish. It does work quite well on all but the most stubborn marks. Actually, now that you mention it... I've never used any conventional wax at all on my airplane - ONLY the Wash and Wax All. Obviously, it pays to attack the little bugs and other nameless lurgies as soon as possible after you land - it's much easier than after their little corpses harden.I have been using Baam and really like it. However, today I applied a product I used to use on my Tiger, and which was developed for antique cars ... called Dry Wash'n Guard (DWG). it sprays on and wipes off. I think it is a polymer finish. The finish is about the smoothest and ""silkiest"" I have ever felt. I was wondering if others have tried these polymers and how they compare in terms of bug resistance and airspeed.Greasy bellyThe absolutely BEST thing I have found for the greasy belly is Marine Grez-Off. I buy it by the gallon and use a garden sprayer to soak the belly. By the time I get to the back I am ready to rinse it off with a garden hose nozzle from the front. SQUEAKY CLEAN and no wiping etc.I used Extreme Simple Green for the first time yesterday - MUCH BETTER than anything I've used before. It took off all the mess that I'd been trying to get off the belly for months. I specifically asked the distributor (senior person at the boot) about fiberglass, he assured me that there is no problem using the product on a Cirrus.Wing Walk AreaI stick with Scrubbing Bubblesand a good, stiff brush. Then MOP or DAB dry - don't rub, because it's like sandpaper.I like covering the wing-walk as much as possible when the airplane's on the ground. If the wing-walk gets dirty at a particular rate, that rate is surely proportional to the number of times it's walked on... and at least in my case, that's a bunch of times BETWEEN flights, although it's really necessary only twice for each flight. I cover the wing-walk with grip shelf lining materialafter each flight.. then leave it on until I'm ready to fly. I pull it into the plane after I've boarded. ACOPA behavior? Maybe... but I find I need to clean the wing walk - among my LEAST favorite cleaning jobs - much less often!Water works reasonably well with a soft scrub brush. I have never used anything else, and they still look good after 4+ years.WaxesI use Race Glazewhich you can find on their web site. It goes on easy and there is also a spray used for in between waxing. It keeps the plane very slippery and shiny. I am thinking of trying Zainowhich is a product I found used by auto buffs on fiberglass bodies. I use it on my car and it is spectacular.We use Mothers Gold Wax,seems to really make finish slick. We have been using a small 6 inch orbital polisherfor removing bugs, just to cut down on elbow usage.I use BAAM.It has been almost 2 years since I used any wax.

(Not needed if you have a painted spinner)Wash and Wax All- This is a spray on product you use without water. I use it on the top and side surfaces.Scrubbing Bubbles and Eliminator - These products work well on the belly of the plane. I will use SB first to get the thick stuff off then Eliminator to finish. It seems to leave less residue than SB.Rejex - Although not a wax it has some wax product in it, Rejex is a good application for twice a year.BAAM- Good stuff for getting bugs off. I usually use it when away from home as well. It goes on and comes off with one application. Spray it on let it sit for 4-5 minutes and the bugs wipe right off. (Eliminator does just a good a job on this as well but it is more expensive so I use the BAAM)Aeroshell Plexicoat- This stuff takes the small scratches out of the windows. Make sure you clean the windows first with lots of water. I apply this stuff once a month.As for towels I buy 12 packs of terry cloth white all purpose towels at Wal Mart for all the initial applications of the above products,then I use a micro fiber towel to go over the final application to polish out a nice shine.As for the TKS screens, I just use a spray bottle of water and a soft cloth after each flight.

Cleaning,3,Paint contamination,https://www.cirruspilots.org/copa/member/sr_aircraft/w/copapedia/paint-contamination.aspx,No, Eharrison,2013-08-16,0,"Cirri which spend a fair amount of their time in coastal areas can be affected by the salt air which not only leads to corrosion, but also helps dirt and pollution stick to the surface of the paint. Even after washing and waxing, the surface of the paint can feel rough - like a very fine grade of sandpaper. Note that this is most likely surface contamination, not oxidation. The roughness will likely be more noticable on the top side of horizontal surfaces than on other surfaces.An excellent method to address this problem is clay detailing. Clay detailing is very simple but highly effective and can be used by anyone. It will restore your paint to ""like new"" condition. Use of a polishing compound is another option for dealing with surface contamination, but it removes a lot of paint material and there is a risk you could polish right down to the composite.ContentsrHow do I know when I need to do clay detailing?How do I do clay detailing?What do I do after clay detailing?How many uses can I get out of a clay bar?Additional ResourcesHow do I know when I need to do clay detailing?After you wash and dry your plane, run your fingertips over the top side of the horizonal surfaces. If you feel roughness, this could be paint contamination. Any number of things can bond with your paint such as airborne dust and pollution. Paint contamination can be worse if your Cirrus is stored outside and is subject to the wetting and drying effect of morning dew.How do I do clay detailing?You can purchase a clay detailing kit from most any auto supply store. Options include the Meguiar's Smooth Surface(TM) Clay Kit and the Mothers?? California Gold?? Clay Bar Paint Saving System. Always wash and dry your plane before clay detailing. Try to do the detailing in a shady, cool and clean work area - like a hangar.First, roll the detailing clay into a ball, then flatten it into a wafer about the size of your palm. Most detailing kits will come with a detailing spray which serves as a lubricant for the clay. Apply a layer of spray to an area you are going to clay. Start with a small area, say one foot square, to get the hang of how the clay works. Holding the clay in your fingers, rub the clay over the lubricated surface with light to medium pressure. If the clay begins to stick, you need more lubricant. You will be able to feel and maybe hear how the clay is taking off the surface contaminants and as you rub, the sound will go away and the clay will move more smoothly. It is doing the job! Keep working the area until the surface contamination is gone. Wipe off any residue and buff the detailed area with a microfiber towel, then move to the next section.As the clay bar removes contaminants from the paint, some of the contaminants will become imbedded in the clay. If you find any hard or large particles in the clay bar, pick them out. Occassionally knead the clay bar, rolling it into a ball and re-forming the wafer to assure you are using fresh clay on your paint.If you drop the clay bar, don't take chances. Throw it away and get it new one. If the clay bar is empregnated with a bunch of grit, you run the risk of scratching your paint. What do I do after clay detailing?After clay detailing, assure that you've removed any remaining lubricant or clay residue. If you are really keen, wash the treated surfaces again, but this is not required. Wax the treated surfaces after clay detailing as you normally would. The combination of washing, clay detailing and waxing will make your paint feel silky smooth, and will probably add a couple knots to your airspeed.How many uses can I get out of a clay bar?Refer to the manufacturer's directions for specific guideance. Generally, you should get at least two details out of a bar. You will notice that the bar will start to take on a brownish color as it becomes full. Store the bar in a ziploc or tupperware-like container when not in use to assure it stays as clean as possible.Additional ResourcesAutopia article on clay detailing - http://www.autopia-carcare.com/inf-clay.htmlMothers detailing guide - http://www.detailguide.com/Meguiar's clay detailing FAQ - http://www.detailguide.com/",22:21:00,Friday

At my SC, we powered up the Cyclone 600 on the bench next to the factory standard Minebea muffin fan and noticed a significantly stronger air flow from every port. Any one of this fan?€?s ports can blow out a birthday candle! The Cyclone 600 seemed to be the best choice for us last SeptemberINSTALLATION OF CYCLONE 600Lancaster Avionics removed our avionics stack and the factory standard Minebea muffin fan. With the stack on the shop work bench they then configured 6 flex hoses for cooling air. They used standard 5/8 inch cooling air hose made for avionics cooling applications. Since the autopilot uses a non-standard size clear cooling hose, an adaptor was used to mate this clear hose to the standard black flex hose. Three of the six hoses were connected just like the factory standard arrangement to the two GPS units and to the autopilot. A 4th hose was tie-wraped to blow on the rear of the audio panel. The 5th hose was connected to the rack mount cooling air provision at the rear of the transponder. The last and 6th hose was ty-wrapped to also blow air at the rear of the transponder. Following are photos of our avionics rack on the workbench with the hoses configured as described here.Looking Down Right Side of the StackLooking Up at the Bottom of the StackIn the photo on the left we cannot see the audio panel because it is too short. But we can see the cooling hose going to both the GPS units. In the photo on the right we clearly see the transponder and the cooling hose connected to the standard fitting at the rear of the transponder?€?s rack. In this photo the transponder has been slid out of its rack. Note that even though the transponder does not have a cooling air input receptacle, the hose now attached to its rack will clearly blow cooling air on the back of the transponder.Next is the topic of where to locate the new fan. IIRC, the factory muffin fan is found in a very crowded space above the co-pilot kick panel. This place is too small for the larger squirrel cage fan. Lancaster Avionics determined the best place to locate our new Cyclone 600 fan would be behind the analog engine instruments. This location provides a short hose distance to the avionics stack. Some other SC?€?s may install new fans here as well. (Don?€?t hold me to this but, I understand some SC?€?s have installed new fans above the pilot side kick panel. I also understand that this location may also be used for optional air conditioning and / or optional TAWS equipment which would make this place not simultaneously useful for a new avionics fan.) Following are photos of our new Cyclone 600 fan installed. The photos were taken before the glare shield was re-installed.View from pilot?€?s seatStanding above the co-pilot windshieldI understand SE Aero has charged less than $1200 (time and materials). Lancaster Avionics quote to us was the same even though it was their first avionics fan change out on a Cirrus. Since ours they?€?ve done others. Both shops said it would be about $300 less if done with any other work requiring removal of the avionics stack.",06:40:00,Friday

Powerplant maintenance,3,Alternator 500 hour overhaul/replacement,https://www.cirruspilots.org/copa/member/sr_aircraft/w/copapedia/367.alternator-500-hour-overhaulreplacement.aspx,No, Roger Whittier,2014-05-16,0,"The Cirrus Aircraft Maintenance Manual 5-10 ""Overhaul & Replacement Schedule"" says ""The following components must be overhauled or replaced at the specified intervals."" (emphasis added). Under ""Alternator 1"", it states ""Per manufacturer, recommended 500 hours"" and refers to Teledyne Continental Motors Manual No. X30531-3. There is no legal requirement to comply with these service intervals under FAR part 91. However, many operators consider it a very good idea to comply to avoid potential damage to the engine should alternator parts deteriorate and contaminate the engine during a failure, not to mention the issue of electrical failure during flight. If your aircraft is under warranty failure to comply may affect your warranty coverage.Other operators feel that replacing an alternator on this schedule is overly conservative, and point to the common early infant mortality of replaced or overhauled alternators.Maintenance DetailsThe Part # for the 60A alternator standard on SR22 prior to SN#1863 is Kelly Aerospace 646843. The Part # for the 100A alternator used on A/C equipped aircraft and all SR22 subsequent to SN#1863 is Kelly Aerospace 649304.The gasket required for the Alternator # 1 R&R is Part # SA629436 The torque spec for the alternator nuts to case-studs is 180-220 in-LbThe cotter key required for the drive adapter R&R is Part # MS24665-302 The torque spec for the drive adapter to the alternator is 25-37.5 Ft-LbMember CommentsFor what it's worth, I do NOT recommend prophylactic alternator overhaul at 500 hours. I consider it a waste of money. I run alternators until they fail (which is usually 1000 hours or more). I don't classify an alternator 1 failure to be a significant safety-of-flight issue in a SR2x. (I realize that not everyone agrees with my position on this.)I spoke with Bill Bainbridge of B&C Specialty Products who makes our #2 Alt. I asked Bill if he could rebuild the #1 and he said no but he knew who could. Bill recommended Terry Norris Sr of Aircraft Systems Inc. http://www.acs-rfd.com They are in Rockford, IL.Bill suggested the following:if you have gotten 500 hours out of your #1 have it rebuilt and make sure they use your core;have your rotor balanced at the same timecheck it at 500 hour intervalsI'm really surprised that so many people are suggesting that you just run your ALT1 into the ground without doing the 500 hour maintenance required by TCM. There are parts (including brushes, bearings, etc.) that absolutely, positively wear out and need to be replaced.The fact that rebuilds or new alternators have infant mortality issues is irrelevant. That's like saying you shouldn't change your oil because sometimes the mechanic messes up something else when he changes the oil. It's ignoring the maintenance needs of the alternator.It's pretty much the same story with the mags, except of course that there is more redundency with two magnetos, but even so, they do need servicing.Believe me, I understand the desire to not throw money at unnecessary maintenance, but on an all-electric airplane, unless you're going to limit yourself to VFR flight, I think ignoring the manufacturer specified maintenance on the alternator is a really bad idea. Magnetos, too.In 2003 and about 450 hours TT in for an Annual on our new 22, the SC ""said"" that Alt 1 ""had"" to be overhauled or replaced. Well I thought: they should know being a SC (even though this was their 1st Cirrus annual)? So $700.00 or so later, with an overhauled unit, off we went.Bad decision! It started a spiraling cast of problems over the next year. Failed: the overhauled Alt 1, replaced Alt 1 with another overhauled unit, MCU chip, Battery #1 fried and replaced, rocker switch panel, new alternator, new battery, and a rebuilt MCU.We were stranded on Sitka, Alaska (an island) for 5 days and Seattle for 5 days during part of this saga.So, would I do as they suggest and replace/repair at 500 hours again? Don't think so! I'll take my chances and do ""watchful waiting"". Oh I am prepared, with a BU unit ready to go.I have had 4 annuals on my Cirrus. I suggest leaving the Alt1 alone until it goes out on you. There is no advantage to changing it or rebuilding it early since one with 50 hours is just as likely to fail as one with 500 hours.I had mine replaced as preventative maintenance at 498 hours. The new one crapped out 3 hours later. It's replacement crapped out 10 hours after that. The next replacement (from a different source this time) has lasted 150 hours and counting - woo-hoo!if it ain't broke don't fix it!It looks like there's a fairly high infant mortality rate, which can cascade to other parts of the electrical system.What I would consider doing (were I still a Cirrus owner) would be to shop around for a nice overhauled unit and keep it in the plane. Whether your original alternator takes a dump in Alaska or Alabama, having a unit ready to go could save a lot of time, money and aggravation.When you alternator does check out, swap it out and then have the original overhauled and keep as a spare. The spare can be taken with you on long out of town trips, as the failure of an alternator is often a ""trip ender"". I don't carry it with me all the time, just when I will be away from home on a long trip.don't forget that if TCM specifies 500 hrs, that's typically tach time.So running to 625 via the Radomsky factor is still within their normal recommendation.Much beyond that and I would start to worry about worn brushes, bearings, etc.Aviation is all about risk management, so each of us have to weigh the factors and advice when we make our mx decisions. We are solely responsible in the end for the airworthiness of our craft.Has anyone checked with an insurance carrier to see what their position is if an accident occurred because of a failure due to overflying the manufactures recommended overhaul period.",06:29:00,Friday
Powerplant maintenance,3,Challenger/K&N air filter,https://www.cirruspilots.org/copa/member/sr_aircraft/w/copapedia/368.challengerk-n-air-filter.aspx,No, Roger Whittier,2014-05-16,0,"The Challenger Aviation Products Challenger Aviation K&N re-cleanable air filter media (part number CPE-1178 at Application Guide) for the normally-aspirated SR22 is installed onto the engine air intake manifold induction duct (14) with a Challenger bracket (replacing bracket model #BA-111) and a self-sticking foam mounting gasket. There are two pieces to the bracket: the top piece to which the mounting gasket is stuck and then attaches to the induction duct and the bottom piece to which the air filter support (15) attaches; the pieces sandwich the filter element. So there are all together four parts to the complete air filter (from top to bottom): the mounting gasket, the top bracket, the filter element, and the bottom bracket. The top bracket is an aluminum plate with a large hole through which filtered air flows into the induction duct. The bottom bracket is also an aluminum plate but with a small hole through which the threaded rod (13) extends.During initial assembly, the air filter element is marked on its top with an FAA-PMA stamp (so you know upon which ends to mount the two plates) and is factory-lubricated with Challenger Filter grease #CP99-0704. There are grooves in the plates which fit onto the air filter (so you know upon which side the two plates are mounted to the filter element). The self-sticking foam mounting gasket is attached centered on the top of the top bracket.During final assembly, the induction duct slides into the mounting gasket which holds the top plate of the air filter assembly snuggly against the induction duct, sealing this junction from leaking unfiltered air. (The aluminum plate is very flat but the induction duct face is not, so the gasket is vital to seal the interface.) The threaded rod is inserted through the bottom plate and secured to the air filter support by washer(s) (5), a castellated nut (10), and cotter pin (9).The manufacturer supplies the STC paperwork: a copy of the STC issued to the owner and stamped with the issue date, aircraft model, serial number, and aircraft registration number. The STC references two other documents which were also supplied by the manufacturer: the FAA Approved Model List and the air filter element cleaning instructions.The italicized words and parenthetical numbers refer to Figure 71-601 of the Cirrus Design Maintenance Manual Revision 6-FEB-2004.A K&N reusable air filter is standard equipment on the Turbo Models of the SR22.",06:25:00,Friday

Put in whatever oil you plan to use for the entire TBO run (I would add: but not one of the antiwear oils, i.e., Exxon Elite, Aeroshell 15W-50, 80+ or 100+).2. Get your fuel flow set up ON THE GROUND to at least 32 gph at 29"" MP on IO-550 normally aspirated engine, or 35 gph on turbo-normalized engine at 30 to 31"" MP. (I would add: you should accomplish the TCM SID 97-3B fuel flow set-up, instructing the mechanic to set the low pressure at the low limit, and high pressure at the high limit, then increase fuel flow further as per previous sentence.)3. Make a normal, full rich, full power take-off and a 135 kt. climb to 1,000 or 1,500' AGL. Then level off. Set cruise RPM. Do the big mixture pull and fly the airplane WOT X 2500RPM at about 16.5 gph and LOP for the next hour or so. If you want to vary the RPM down to 2200 or 2100 and back up to 2500 or 2700, that is fine. If any CHT goes above 380dF, lean it some more. If that does not work, land and see what is wrong. Otherwise, land, check for leaks and stuff that is ""wrong."" Make adjustments.4. Make a normal cross-crountry somewhere and come home with about 4.5 to 6.0 hours total time on the engine. Land and drain the oil while it is hot. Cut the filter. It should have some metal in it, but no part numbers. During this trip, you should try to get the plane (fast cruise climb) up to 12-15,000 MSL to ""stretch"" or exercise the rubber induction couplings and see if one will come off (you will know it if this happens!). Have the mechanic tighten up all the induction clamps after this trip to altitude. Always keep the CHT's under 380 dF.5. New oil; new filter. Engine is broken in at four hours or so. (I would add: reset fuel flow down to about 29.5 gph for a NA engine.) After another 15 to 20 hours, change the oil and check the filter (it should have about 5% as much metal as the first time.) Send oil out for first analysis.6. Enjoy your airplane!...with thanks to our resident engine guru--Walter Atkinson!",22:10:00,Friday

The engine flush procedure takes 3 days. After first wash let it sit overnight, the same after second wash and third wash. You can do a couple of washes without out the benefit of some soaking then the procedure can be done in 1 day. It is better to do it over several days.2. Pre-mix a mixture of Seafoam, 100LL, oil. Mix 50% Seafoam, 50% 100LL and 1 quart of Engine oil. One gallon of Sea Foam, 1 Gal of 100LL and 1quart of oil. Oil helps lubricate cylinders. The mixture should be done in the approved gasoline container.Note: This is messy work. Use pet pads to cover area under the engine to avoid spilling all this stuff on the concrete floor in your hangar.3. The above mixture is flammable and should be kept in an approved gasoline type container. Be careful. When you are finished with engine flush, dispose the remaining liquid in the oil or solvent dump station at the airport.4. It would be safer to do flush outside or with hangar doors door partially open to eliminate collection of fumes.5. After mixing you will have total of 544 oz of liquid. Distribute mixture into 6 empty water bottles 8oz each. These later will be used to pour liquid into each cylinder.You will need 8oz x 6 cylinders x 3 washes = 144 oz. The original mixture will be able to wash almost 4 airplanes.6. The engine needs to be cold, 65-80F. You are handling too much stuff, no need to have hot engine while doing this procedure.7. Tightly Screw Top Dead Center Indicator into Spark Plug Hole Adapter. This assembly later will be used to find Top Dead Center (TDC) and to move piston back to allow room for mixture.Preparations are now completed8. Remove top and bottom cowling and carefully place them away from the airplane so that there is no spilling on the cowling.9. Remove all the top plugs and carefully place them in safe place so they are not dropped and damaged during this process. If you have old ones use them for this procedure.10. Disconnect the ignition leads from the bottom spark plugs but leave the plugs in. You can use the current ones. If you have some old ones use them - only because you are going to handle them a lot and the risk of dropping one is high.11. Find Top Dead Center for Cylinder number one. The back right (as viewed from the cockpit) is number one. As you come up on the compression stroke there will be a substantial blast of air coming up out of the cylinder (you cannot hold the thumb in place while this is happening).Hand screw TDC indicator into the cylinder #1 sparkplug location. Continue to rotate prop until indicator is at the top reading. Now back prop 3 notches on the indicator. This will give you exactly 8 oz space in the cylinder head.12. Pour content of one 8 fl oz bottle into cylinder #1 using Multi-Purpose funnel until cylinder is about full - at the bottom of the spark plug threads.13. Re-install sparkplug into cylinder #1 and tighten it by hand and then with a wrench just a bit. Just a tad more than hand tight will do.CAREFULLY and GENTLY pull the prop through the rest of the compression stroke. NOTE, YOU ARE HYDRAULICALLY LOCKING THE ENGINE, DO NOT USE THE STARTER MOTOR. Gently, using constant pressure work this mixture through the rings. You will hear some sounds as this stuff works past rings though ring gaps and works its way to the crankcase. That is good, it is flowing through the rings and ring grooves. Eventually it will clear take your time and do not force it. Move through the cylinders in firing order repeating it in every cylinder.14. Continue turning prop and pour liquid in the following cylinder sequence is 1-6-3-2-5-4. From there the next cylinder to come up on its compression stroke is cylinder 6 (front left cylinder). It will come up on its compression stroke immediately after number 1. Staying in firing order minimizes the effort and keep you moving with the engine as the cylinders naturally move. If you forget this firing sequence it is stamped on the engine data plate on the right upper part of the crankcase.15. When all 6 cylinders are filled with liquid, let it sit overnight. Repeat this process 3 days in a row from step 9. So each cylinder will have 3 washing cycles.16. Now you will have a lot of unacceptable stuff in the crankcase (Seafoam, fuel and whatever it dislodged) so DO NOT START THE ENGINE.17. Remove all plugs (top and bottom)18. Rotate the prop through 20 to 25 times to clear as much Sea Foam as possible and to insure as much as you can is out of the piston and exhaust system.19. Drain the oil and the rest of the Sea Foam into approved oil collection container. Do not change the oil filter at this time.20. Put spark plugs back with a new washers and properly torque them. (you may use little of the anti-seize compound to make threading sparkplug easier)21. Add fresh 8 quarts of oil to the engine.22. Fly airplane for 3 hours23. Change the oil and filter as the oil will get really dirty really fast. Do not forget to safety wire oil filter back into its place.24. Cut open the filter to inspect it. You will see different stuff, what appears to be flat pieces of carbon from the ring grooves. Don?€?t not bother with an oil analysis on those oil changes, it will have some really weird findings. Running engine after this wash continues to dislodge stuff for a while, so results may improve over time after this procedure.25. Make the following engine log entry: ?€?Removed cowling, removed, serviced and rotated plugs, changed oil, changed oil filter. Hobbs ????hrs.?€?",06:21:00,Friday

A good GAMI spread is .2 GPH (Gallons per Hour).Smaller GAMI spreads result in:Smoother engine operation, since more equal fuel is reaching each cylinderIncreased ability to lean farther without roughness, resulting in more efficient engine operationA reduced risk of operating a cylinder in the Red FinHigh GAMI spreads can be a sign of:Clogged InjectorsInduction system leaksMismatched fuel injector flow rates and/or induction system variancesAnother engine diagnostic test is theInflight LOP Magneto Check.GAMI Lean Test (from GAMI)Normally Aspirated Engines with Multiprobe Digital EGT Display:Set up cruise between 5,000 to 7,000ft, approx 65% (or some setting that keeps CHTS<400??F) with RPMs at your normal cruise setting.Find peak on the first cylinder.Enrich the mixture to about 1 or 2 gph rich of that peak.Record the FF and each EGT and CHT.Lean in a small increment (0.2 or 0.3 gph with digital FF).Repeat steps 4 and 5 until you are lean of peak on all cylinders (all EGTs start dropping in temperature).Turbocharged / Turbonormalized Engines with Multiprobe Digital EGT Display:Set up cruise between 8,000 to 10,000ft, approx 65% (or some setting that keeps CHTS<400??F and TIT<1650??F) with RPMs at your normal cruise setting.Find peak on the first cylinder.Enrich the mixture to about 1 or 2 gph rich of that peak.Record the FF and each EGT and CHT.Lean in a small increment (0.2 or 0.3 gph with digital FF).Repeat steps 4 and 5 until you are lean of peak on all cylinders (all EGTs start dropping in temperature).GAMI Lean Test VariationsInduction System Leaks can be verified by running a GAMI Lean Test at differing MPs. Induction System leaks will increase at higher differential pressures, and be reflected in a change in the order of peaking cylinders.The GAMI Lean Test involves running the GAMI WOT lean test a a lower and higher altitude (say 3K and 9K). The high altitude test is run first, with wide open throttle, and the precise manifold pressure is noted. The low altitude test is run with power set to achieve the same manifold pressure as the high altitude test. A different cylinder peak pattern between the LO and HI tests may indicate an induction system leak.The pattern should be the same from the two altitudes BECAUSE, if there is no leak, there will be no change in F:A ratios. One reason there are many times that an existing induction leak is NOT found is that the mechanic presurizes the system. That can find gross leaks, but it will oftentimes not find subtle leaks. Why? Because the leak is INTO the induction system, not OUT of it. It can leak IN and not OUT. These subtle leaks can be form old couplings, clamps that are either not tight enough, or too tight, or other sources of leaks like cracks in the metal or a leaking induction gasket.GAMI WebsiteGAMI Lean Test Instructions",04:53:00,Monday
Powerplant maintenance,3,Magneto 500 hour inspection/overhaul,https://www.cirruspilots.org/copa/member/sr_aircraft/w/copapedia/373.magneto-500-hour-inspectionoverhaul.aspx,No, Peter Storer,2014-05-19,0,"There is conflicting information on what should, could, and must to be done with magnetos, both on the COPA forums and from different shops.Here is a summary of the facts on the issue:Normal 100 hour maintenance, covered in a by-the-book annual, includes adjusting the points and setting the ignition timing on each mag, which does not require removal.The Cirrus maintenance manual defers to TCM (the engine mfr.) when it comes to the service interval for inspecting or overhauling the magnetos.There are no legally required Airworthiness Directives covering the SR22 mags, but a well known AD is often incorrectly invoked by some shops due to its applicability to other versions of the IO-550 engine.TCM, in addition to their service manual, has issued a Service Bulletin SB643B which specifies certain 'mandatory' service requirements, including the 100 hour (annual) inspection and the following:500 hour detailed inspection, which requires the magnetos to be removed from the aircraft, and among other things, inspecting the impulse coupling.Overhaul or replacement after four years in service, regardless of time in service. Note that the 500 hour inspection does not satisfy the overhaul or replacement requirement, as the overhaul replaces many components regardless of condition while the inspection does so only as needed.SBs, even when called 'mandatory' by manufacturers, are not required for legal continued airworthiness, but are considered by many to be a very good idea to follow.There is a wide range of opinion about what work is appropriate, with some shops ignoring this inspection and others even suggesting replacing the magnetos entirely. Some operators agree that magnetos do indeed wear and they should be serviced rather than being run until they fail. And they will fail.Due to the wide range of opinions on this issue, it is a good idea to be very specific with your shop regarding the details of any work done on your magnetos, and insure that the logbook entry describes specifically what has been done. If the work is done to the extent specified in TCM SB643B you should insure that the logbook entry specifies this. A generic description such as ""Overhauled magnetos"" or ""Inspected magnetos"" is not adequate.Replacing a set of mags with overhauled ones may cost as much as $2000.A magneto inspection may cost as much as $700, not including the cost of any needed work identified during the inspection.Member Comments500-hour magneto maintenance is absolutely essential for safe operation. I heartily recommend Sierra Magneto Service Inc.:http://sierramagneto.com/Andy Richards Sierra Magneto Service, Inc 13344 Grass Valley Avenue, Unit G Grass Valley, CA 95945 Phone: 530-272-7289In my opinion, Andy is the best magneto guy in the business. He's a craftsman and a perfectionist, and his prices are extremely reasonable. Figure $200 to $300 per magneto for the 500-hour service, depending on what parts need to be replaced.DO NOT ask for an ""overhaul"" -- it's not needed at 500 hours and will just cost you extra. The magneto service manual is very specific about exactly what needs to be done each 500 hours.For what it's worth, I do NOT recommend prophylactic alternator overhaul at 500 hours. I consider it a waste of money. I run alternators until they fail (which is usually 1000 hours or more). I don't classify an alternator 1 failure to be a significant safety-of-flight issue in a SR2x. (I realize that not everyone agrees with my position on this.)Chapter 5 in the maintenance manual gives you the overhaul and replacement requirements. 500 hour on the mags is a inspection requirement by the magneto mfg. Some mags fall into the AD for impulse coupling inspections at 500 hours. Seeing more aircraft at the 5 year time time and owners not expecting the 5 year items in chapter 5 (copy for ref. attached). Be aware of the extra cost at annual time.I don't think I've ever done a 500-hour inspection of my mags without replacing at least some parts (points, carbon brushes, felts, oil seals) and generally I replace the distributor block every other inspection. At my 2000-hour inspection (NOT an overhaul), I sent my mags to Andy at Sierra Magneto Service, and he replaced the bearings and oil slingers and condensers as well.I guarantee you that if you send your mags to Sierra Magneto and specify that you want a 500-hour inspection, Andy will replace everything that needs replacing.I won't name any names here, but some FAA-approved magneto repair stations do a great job with mags, and others do a not-so-great job. (I've found the same to be true of instrument repair stations and prop shops.) If you have your local A&P do the 500-hour magneto inspection, anything can happen.ANDY is no longer associated with SIERRA MAGNETO. He is now located at Power Aviation Services in Auburn, CA.

Excellent service, nice people, and a good product at a reasonable price.- Tony L. PfafOther sources:Aviation Oil Analysis in PhoenixHoward Fenton at SeconOilpinion, Tulsa, OK, (918) 492-5844 - [emailprotected]my latest oil analysis showed a continuing significant uptrend in nickel on the right engine (nickel comes from the exhaust valve guide) but not a very significant increase in chrome (which comes from the exhaust valve stem). So I'm pretty sure that this time it's the guide that wore out rather than the stem.- Mike Buschoil analysis numbers are not so valuable in an absolute sense as they are in showing trends - something changing compared to a baseline history. On the other hand many analysis companies tag reports with an ""abnormal"" label if the number falls out of an unspecified range. Blackstone provides a comparison number that I believe is an average of other engines of the same type based on their experience.u2028u2028How far from the ""average"" is just flat out a problem? How much do perfectly good airplanes deviate from the average on a normal basis, without indicating a ""problem"" engine?u2028u2028My understanding is that oil analysis companies simply report the concentration of metals that wear and other stuff like silicon (dirt) in parts per million. The more hours on oil, the more material it will collect, naturally. So analysis numbers can vary from sample to sample based simply on the number of hours on the oil. 50-hour-old oil can be presumed to contain quite a bit more wear metal than 25-hour-old oil. So while oil analysis reports show, I think, raw analysis numbers, some folks think that factoring in the time on the levels the playing field when comparing multiple samples side-by-side.- Tim GieselerVarious metals in the oil are symptomatic of various problems:CopperBearings, bushings, starter adapters, and oil coolersIronRust from idle periods.Fe (elemental iron) readings in oil analysis can suggest among many things, piston ring wear, lifter spalling, camshaft wear, normal cylinder wear etc.high iron is most often associated with cylinder side wall pitting corrosion.

Powerplant maintenance,3,Oil change,https://www.cirruspilots.org/copa/member/sr_aircraft/w/copapedia/375.oil-change.aspx,No, John Ylinen,2014-04-30,3,"A good reason to do your own oil change, or at least to be present when the ritual is performed, is that it gives you the opportunity to inspect all things forward of the firewall and to ensure that all the little maintenance items are attended to.

Imported to COPApedia by rhelsing. Modified by n521jlToday my friend Alex kept me company while I did an oil change on N1MR, so I pressed him into service as a photographer. I've been wanting to document the process I use for a long time, but oily hands and cameras don't go together well (not to mention simply not having enough hands).CAVEAT 1 - My usual: What I do isn't necessarily smart, proper,correct, etc... emulate at your peril. Mostly, what I'm hoping to get outof this is good feedback from others who do their own oil changes -suggestions on how to do things better/smarter/cleaner/faster/safer etc.CAVEAT 2 - An oil change provides a great opportunity to do lots ofother things, many of which are documented in posts like this one.(Actually, the entire thread has lots of good ideas). I documented afew, but not all of these. One I wish I'd photographed was the lubingof the throttle/governor cables - I'll try to remember to do that inabout 30 engine hours from now.CAVEAT 3, 4 etc... Mine is a late 2003 vintage SR22. There are slightdifferences among models, particularly in the design of the cowling.Not all the photos came out properly - I've used some 'substandard'ones where I felt the content was still worthwhile. Some of thesequences could easily be done in a different order; others make sense(to me) only the way I do them.Here goes...1) Prepare for surgery:It is important that everything that you need is available for your at the time you do oil change. Write everything you need and buy it ahead of time. The initial investment is about $290 to $400. Once the essential tools are purchased, a typical oil change will cost you $70 to $90. The variation is due to oil type, oil analysis and oil filter prices.Estimate 4-5 hours on your first time and then 3-4 hours on subsequent changes. The most important thing to remember: ""Slow is fast"". Do not rush through it, take your time and you will complete it faster than you expected.Here is what I prepared before I started oil change:2) Remove the four screws that hold the upper/lower cowl halves together behind the propeller:3) Orient the propeller with one blade down in preparation for upper cowl removal:4) Undo the quick-release catches along the sides and top of the upper cowl:5) Carefully remove the upper cowl:6) Place the cowl shell on a piece of cardboard, carpeting, etc; inspect inside for evidence of scuffing, scraping, friction, heat etc.7) Unscrew and remove plate behind the nose wheel strut (Note: For the G2 Series the bottom cowling is in two halves and you need to unscrew the connections between the halves and remove each half of the cowl separately):8) Re-orient the propeller with one blade straight up for lower cowl removal:9) Disconnect the landing light connector near the external power connector/MCU and tape it to the side of the plane. Release all but the two topmost quick-release catches for the lower cowl shell. On my airplane, the final step in removing the lower cowl takes two people (hence no photo). Each stands on one side, releases the top catch, stick the screwdriver in their back pocket, and ""persuade"" the cowl down the nose wheel strut. Some pulling by each away from the longitudinal centerline of the airplane is needed to spread the cowl so that it doesn't scrape the blades of the propeller as it comes off.10) Landing light connector taped to the side of the plane, so that I don't forget to connect it later...11) Inspect the inside of the lower cowl shell as done with the upper shell in step (6), then stow on soft surface:12) Set up container for receiving oil. I use a plastic thingy I bought at a car parts store, designed for oil changes. I use a couple of small garbage cans to stand it below the engine, mostly because I keep forgetting to buy a longer hose than the one I've been using for the last four years I attach the hose to the quick-drain, push it up and give it a twist to start the oil flow.13) After the oil has been flowing for about 30 seconds, I capture a small sample to send to Blackstone Labs for analysis:14) Using an awl and a small hammer, I punch a couple of holes in the oil filter so that it can empty properly. In this thread, Fred Sponsler and Roger Whittier suggested waiting overnight after this step, but today I was impatient. I waited about an hour while I did lots of other things, and I had minimal oil mess when I finally removed the filter.15) Now's the time to do other stuff so that the oil has a chance to drain completely. I start by giving the entire engine a good rub with the Mark I eyeball:16) Is there anyone who doesn't need a ladder to inspect the top half?17) I open the brake master cylinder...18) ... and check the level using a homemade ""dip stick"". A cable tie works well. This one's a little fancier - I cut it out from some (nylon?) stuff that was used as a strap around a cardboard carton. It has a 'shoulder' that stops it at the top of the cylinder, which makes it easier to judge how far the MIL - H5606 is from the top.19) This day my brake fluid level was fine. I use a kitchen baster to add fluid if needed.20) Time to check the battery electrolyte levels. I start by removing the battery cover using 7/16 socket:21) Next, I remove the individual caps for the cells. Today, all but one cell - the one on the right in the photo - were fine. The level on the one cell was a little low. The difference is vivid to the eye, much more subtle in the photo. The clue is that the surface of the electrolyte in the rightmost cell is flat, while there is a complex-shape meniscus in the ones that have enough.Here's some important tips to remember: From this post.If you're low on fluid, never ever add acid back. Only add distilled water until it is 1/4 above the plates.SLOW CHARGE battery using 2A until its back to full charge, THEN replace the remaining missing fluid with more distilled water until at the top fill line.Ok, why do it this way you ask? Well...Apparently if you try to fill all the way to the top and then charge the stuff will overflow, which could create a mess or worse a hazard. Why overflow? Because the plates will give up fluid when charging. On the other hand, if plates remain exposed somehow, when charging at the pace of the built-in alternators (instead of gently by a battery minder or tabletop 2A etc) you can boil off even more, which could lead to battery death from the plates overheating. (Trust me on this point, I fried my boat's generator battery and it was ugly).So, after topping enough WATER just above the plates, and AFTER slowly charging it up, THEN you finish off with more water to completely bring the volume to full in the cell.22) I use a turkey-baster to add distilled water to bring up the level where needed:23) Put the caps back and dry up the inevitable spills:24) There are lots of places to get distilled water - Walgreens sells it for ironing, automotive stores sell it for radiators and batteries. As far as I know, any distilled water is fine.25) After I've completed ALL the ""engine housekeeping"" - including inspecting the air filter, lubing the throttle and governor cables, etc., it's time to finish up the oil change. I start by putting some rolled-up paper towel under the oil filter, much the way my barber puts something around my neck. He catches hair, I'm hoping to catch oil drips. This step can be painful if the engine is still hot!26) Now I cut the safety wire that would otherwise prevent the oil filter from being removed:27) I use a 1 inch socket wrench to remove the filter:28) I clean the base of the oil filter mount with a paper towel, taking care not to leave any residue behind. Note the remaining safety wire, which I cut off:29) I place the oil filter on the oil drain pan so that any remaining oil can exit.30) My new CH48108-1 filter...31) I record date, Hobbs and oil type (who knows who might be doing the next oil change)32) Before installing the new filter, safety wire must be put in place and ""started"". I cut a piece about three times as long as the filter itself:33) I feel for the hole at the base of the filter mount by braille - it's impossible to see - and thread the wire through. Then I use a safetywire- twisty-thingy to twist just enough to reach the top of the filter:34) I wipe my finger clean (honest!) then spread a thin layer of Dow Corning 4 (a.k.a. ""DC-4"") paste onto the filter gasket35) Installing the filter is simply a question of spinning it onto its screw thread until it's ""wrist tight"", then tighten a little more with a socket wrench. Technically, one should tighten to the correct torque - used to do that, until I found that I can get it just about ""on the money"" every time by feel. After it's in place, the other end of the safety wire needs to be attached to an ""ear"" on the filter, in a direction that would prevent the filter from LOOSENING. Sometimes those ears are practically flat against the filter top, so I have to raise the ear a tad to get the wire through - this was the case today.36) I use the safety-wire-twisty-thingy tool to finalize the safety wire. To be strictly correct, the wire should be twisted in the opposite direction after passing this 'node', but I've been assured by an IA friend that this rule is among many that are commonly ignored in most shops. What's important is that it's not going to come undone... and that the end is bent over, so that it doesn't impale the next hand that wanders by.37) Time to start adding back oil. It's very important to remove the tube that runs to the drain pan below - I don't want to be yet another guy who pours eight quarts THROUGH his engine, into the drain pan! With the tube removed, any leak from my quick drain will be very obvious. I give each quart a good long time - no rush, because I've still got plenty to do. I leave the quart bottle in the funnel to drain while I go about the rest of the steps, and come back from time to time to add another quart.38) My main remaining job is to cut open the filter, so that I can get a good look at the filter element and send a sample off to Howard Fenton at SECOND OilPINION. I use a simple cutter that I bought from Aircraft Spruce & Specialty Company.39) A sharp knife is needed to cut some of the pleats so that they can be removed. Four cuts are needed - along both sides, then front and back:40) Oil spatters all over as the filter concertina is spread - a good excuse to be wearing a grungy T-shirt!41) The Q&D examination is done in sunlight - look for glints of metal on the surface that was on the outside of the filter. There's always some. After a few oil changes, you get a feel for what's normal.42) I don't throw the empty quart bottles away until I think I'm done; then I count them, to be sure I've added as much oil as I meant to!43) The final step is to start the engine and run it for a few minutes. I watch the oil pressure gauge with extra vigilance on the first start after the oil change - the book says to shut down if there's no oil pressure within 30 seconds, but I've never come close. Three or four seconds usually does it. When I remember, I crank the engine with the mixture at idle cutoff for a few blades, wait to see oil pressure, then let the engine start. Not sure whether that's good, but it works within just a few blades. I haven't done that yet - I don't like starting the engine unless I'm going flying, so that will happen tomorrow. Here is a sample document of what I print, sign and paste into my engine log book.To make the logbook entry legal, you must sign it and include your pilot certificate number and certificate type (e.g., ""123456789 Commercial Pilot"").",06:08:00,Wednesday

Champion 48108-1 - Short Body, standard media area and oil volume. This is the oil filter that is installed as the OEM (=Original Equipment Manufacturer) filter at the Cirrus factory. This filter is generally used for cost savings and in installations where filter length or access is restricted.2. Champion 48109-1 - Tall Filter. This filter is TCM approved as completely interchangeable with the shorter filter in the IO-550-N Cirrus installation. It provides increased filter media area and holds more oil.There is no downside to using this filter in the SR22. The benefit include approximately 50% greater filter media area and the resultant ability to hold more contaminants before the filter media becomes full and oil by-passes the filter.This filter has PMA approval to be used on the IO-550-N. Some mechanics will tell you that can't use this filter on your SR-22, but they are uninformed.3. Tempest 48109, an equivalent to the Champion 48109-1, but with a magnetic pickup. The Tempest have a magnet built into the drive nut so all ferrous material is visible when the filter is opened for inspection. Pleats are uniform and well sealed to the end caps.

They mount some vibration recording equipment to the engine and a optical device (a reflector on the prop and a pickup) so they know engine rotation location. Then they start it and run it at cruise RPM's. They look for the amount of grams out of balance and the location it needs to be installed. Then they put a weight on the inside of the prop spinner at that location. It can make a noticeable improvement. In my case the engine was smoother by a noticeable, but hard to describe, amount. The issue is at the factory they all balance, I believe statically, components like props, engines, etc...

The left mag drives the left TOP plugs (the even numbered side) and the Right bottom ones. Correspondingly, the right mag drives the right top (the odd numbered ones) and left bottom. From there if you know the cylinder number, say for example number 2, then the plug would be the one driven by the left mag or top one.Figure 1. Spark plugs locationOutright failuresMost outright failures are not from the plug wearing out and then failing. It comes from a random internal failure or more often... mishandling - the mechanic dropping it on the ground. If your bird has been in the shop recently that's what I'd suspect. And it's just as likely to happen when the same guy has to handle another twelve plugs.If you have a TCM Platinum engine you already have fine wire plugs which, with careful cleaning, should last you to TBO. If you really want new ones... order your plugs yourself and give them to the guy. 100% markup is a bit rich. We went with Autolite Fine Wires which were a very good value and have worked perfectly since.Be careful though and instruct your mechanic not to sandblast your plugs. Use the Champion vibrating cleaner and a dental pick. Sandblasting wears them out way to fast. Also, plugs should be rotated like tires. The polarity causes electrode wear in different directions.

The engine will run better if you keep the plugs properly gapped. Walter AtkinsonI'd say it depends on the flying and leaning procedures you do on the ground or at low altitudes. Also the field elevation you operate at. I operate a Citabria and we run it full rich all the time. Albeit less than 5'000 agl. every time we go out. So 50 hr oil changes is the base line for plug cleaning. I found the bottom plugs need it most. Rarely need to gap, unless the plugs are pretty old. - Harrison SmithDon't forget that if you're using hobbs time, you can run to 125 hours to equal roughly 100 tach hours (using the Radomsky factor of .8). -Ed BensonFine Wire Spark PlugsOne man's opinion:In my professional experience, fine wire plugs are less prone to lead fouling, spark gap remains uniform for more 2X hours than massive, life of plug will be close to TBO compared to 300 to 600 hours life of massive electrode. Fine wires in general, seem to help with a quicker start and a slight improvement in fuel economy if you are paying close attention. (Walter has said that it appears to advance timing slightly in the test cell..) On the down side they cost around $60 each as compared to $20+ for the massive plugs, (I don't recommend the Unison plugs). Jim BarkerI switched to fine wire (expensive) spark plugs at about 1500 hours and have run them for another 400 hours. They certainly last as long as my 3 earlier sets of plugs and they are still running well. I was getting oil fouling of the massive electrode (cheaper) spark plugs and couldn't get them to clean up by running really lean. I had two cases of failed plugs due to oil deposits on the plug tips. Switched and had good results. Fine wire spark plugs apparently produce a sufficiently different spark, perhaps hotter, such that I have been able to keep them from fouling despite an increasing level of oil consumption. - Rick BeachMember Commentsit is a good idea to alternate the placement of the spark plugs to reverse polarity. This will extend the life of massive electrode plugs.We went to Autolite fine wires at around 700 hours. Great deal at OSH and always less expensive than the Champion's. They also seem to have incorporated some improvements.The magnetos used in our ignition systems fire half the spark plugs with positive polarity and half with negative polarity. Plugs that fire with negative polarity wear the center electrode, while plugs that fire with positive polarity wear the ground electrodes. In order to balance the wear and get maximum life from the plugs, we rotate the plugs every 100 hours so the ones that were in negative-positions move to positive-positions, and vice-versa. (We do this for much the same reasons as we rotate car tires.)For a six-cylinder engine like the IO-550-N, the recommended plug rotation sequence is:1T <---> 6B 2T <---> 5B 3T <---> 4B 4T <---> 3B 5T <---> 2B 6T <---> 1BThis sequence assures that each plug spends half its time in negative and positive positions, and half its time in top and bottom positions. (Bottom plugs are abused more than top plugs bcause they are exposed to more oil and crud.)Each magneto produces spark pulses of alternating polarity. If the engine has an odd number of cylinders (like radials do), then each spark plug winds up getting alternating polarity spark pulses. But if the engine has an even number of cylinders (like our flat engines do), then half the plugs always get positive spark pulses, and the other half of the plugs always get negative spark pulses. That causes some plugs to wear out the ground electrodes and other plugs to wear out the center electrode. Rotating the plugs periodically (suggested every 100 hours) so that each plug winds up in an alternate-polarity spot helps equalize the wear on the electrodes and to give longer plug life. I hope this clarifies the situation for you.Massive-electrode plugs, when properly maintained (i.e., cleaned, gapped and rotated every 100 hours), typically will last 400 to 500 hours. They should be retired when the center electrode (which starts out cylindrical) has eroded to an eliptical cross-section whose minor axis is 50% of the major axis.This picture shows a massive spark plug on the left pulled from an SR22 after 600 hours. On the right shows a plug with less than 100 hours. The plane has primarily been run LOP. The left plug clearly shows a worn out plug has turned eliptical.Fine-wire (irridium) plugs cost approximately three times as much as massives, and last approximately three times as long -- i.e., 1200 to 1500 hours. The cost/hour is just about a push with massives. Fine-wires still should be cleaned, gapped and rotated, but in an engine operated LOP you can probably get away with doing that every 200 or 300 hours instead of 100 hours.After many years of using Champion spark plugs, I now use Unison Autolite massive-electrode plugs (URHB-32Es) in my airplane. The Autolites are significantly less expensive than Champions, and I believe that they are superior spark plugs in several respects. For one thing, they are nickel-plated which prevents them from corroding. (Champions are painted, not plated.) For another, the first threads of their barrels are tapered slightly which makes them much easier to install (compared to Champions). And of course, they're several bucks cheaper per plug. What's not to like?n my experience, the Unison plugs have much higher failure rates, erratic resistance, erratic dimensions of electrode protrusion and ground ear relationships....in short NOT worth the money savings at all! Who cares if the pig has lipstick when it still is a pig? Champions may not be the ultimate plug but they are worth more in reliability, uniformity and fewer maintenance visits than saving $5 to $8 bucks per plug.Borescope Inspection",05:57:00,Friday

They simply are not subject to the abuse or exposure that the under cowling hoses are. The interior toe brake hoses will be a bear to change out. It is strongly recommend that SC inspects every inch of them visually and by feel to ensure there is no chafe points or other damage.If SC have already taken them out go with the straight 124 Teflon for the rest of the brake system. It is very flexible and easier to install.Finally, ask your SC to flush the brake system of the old brake fluid while they are doing this work. Brake fluid tends to pick up water and can cause corrosion in the system in the long run.For the fuel and oil lines definitely change them out to the 124K Teflon with integral fire sleeve. You can fly with those hoses for 20 years.If you want to shop for prices simply measure the hoses from end of fitting to end of fitting and note whether it is a straight, 45 or 90 fitting on each end and the ""dash"" size of the hose (ask your mechanic to mark this on the hose)and email in advance for a quote to your favorite house shop.It is strongly recommend using Teflon hoses with integral (brown) fire sleeve for all applications except those which are subject to a high level of repetitive flex (e.g., brake hoses on an aircraft with oleo struts and torque links, or some hydraulic actuator installations). Teflon hoses have a much longer service life than conventional synthetic rubber hoses, but are somewhat less tolerant of extreme flexing.Here some additional thoughts: 1. Hoses must be TSO'd. They'll have a metal band on them documenting when made-up, who did it, etc.2. There are different schools of thought about fire sleeves. Some say they hold engine heat in, thus prematurely deteriorating the hoses. I don't know of any data to support this. I like fire sleeves, and newer designs of some hoses have integral fire sleeves. It'll add several hundred dollars to your order. Personally, I like them forward of the firewall, but the cost is likely why OEM's don't use them.3. Again, the braided ones are more expensive, so the OEM's don't use them. I think they are unnecessary in intermittent pressure (e.g., brake lines) applications, unless in an area where chafing is a reasonable possibility. In constant pressure hydraulic systems I have a different view, but that's not us.4. What Sac. Sky Ranch is telling you is the SOP for hose replacement. But it takes time to remove, ship to the hose shop, have them made-up, then returned to you for installation. Ask about turn-around time.5. The hose shop does need to know length, type hose, type fittings (straight, 45 degree, sleeved, etc.) before a binding quote can be given. You can request a ballpark estimate once number of hoses, type materials and general length is estimated. You can ask for this nonbinding ""guess"" if you wish, but hose manufacturing is pretty competitive. I'd be surprised if you get big swings in cost, so you may want to have someone close to you do it. For example, I use API because I can hand carry a hose to them for make-up while I wait.It is believed a five year hose change cycle is gross overkill. I don't plan to do it, and will change them on condition, meaning, are they brittle? Stiff? Showing any signs of leakage? Cracking? Bulging? Fraying anywhere? Dirty from engine oil? Exposed to heat? Been on a tied-down airplane? But it is an entirely personal choice. I've never seen a five-year old un-abused hose that wasn't airworthy, and I've seen lots that were 20 years old that were still OK. But check those near a heat source, like at the brake caliper, closely. Those usually go first. If it were a crop duster around harsh chemicals and that sat out, a five year change cycle could make sense. The five-year change cycle is a bullet-proof, nobody can abuse hoses to make them fail sooner, hose manufacturer's recommendation. Cirrus Design is simply doing the liability-avoidance thing by parroting their recommendation. But this is a personal choice. I'm making no recommendation, just saying what I plan to do. If you're planning on selling the airplane within the next year, the prospective buyer could insist the hoses be changed.Several mechanics have told me the ""replace all hoses at 5 yrs"" rule is outdated since current materials are more reliable and they would only replace on an as needed basis.It should be noted that flexible brake and oil hoses are listed in chapter 5 of the AMM, time limits and maint checks, as a replacement item every 5 years. Chapter 4 details airworthy requirements and refers to chapter 5. In other words to maintain airworthy requirements the hoses MUST be replaced.",04:01:00,Friday
Powerplant maintenance,3,Starters and starter adapters,https://www.cirruspilots.org/copa/member/sr_aircraft/w/copapedia/381.starters-and-starter-adapters.aspx,No, Roger Whittier,2014-05-16,0,"There exists a significant body of posts in the COPA Forum relating to starter/starter drive problems. The starting system on the TCM engines is not familiar nor intuitive to many.This article should help you understand the system so that you may make your own informed decisions on the maintenance of your aircraft.ContentsWhat to do when your starter or starter drive fails:Work with your service centerOverhauling starter driveBasic Operation ExplanationProblemsSystem VariationsFrom the Sky Tech websiteIt has been edited for brevity here:Member CommentsWhat to do when your starter or starter drive fails:If your motor starting system starts to slip, grind or make other noises, it will not get better on its own. It can only get worse.Figure 1. Failed cog.It is generally not an immediate safety of flight risk but should be addressed as a relatively urgent snag, not deferred to the next Annual or 100 Hour Inspection. Accelerated starter drive wear may show up as high iron in oil analysis.Change your oil and filter, with an oil analysis after a starter drive failure as larger metal particles may have entered the oil system. Note the starter drive failure on your oil analysis form to avoid the frantic call from the lab!.It is worth noting that there are very few reports of failure of the actual electric starter motor nor the electrical system. Starter problems are predominantly reported as involving the starter drive adapter.Failure or excessive wear of the starter drive adapter can cause metal contamination of the oil and may result in internal damage to the engine requiring a complete engine teardown and possible overhaul.Whether your failure occurs in or out of Warranty it may be a prudent investment of $500 to install the Sky-Tech C24 ST3 starter motor.This motor will reduce the possibility of future damage to the expensive and troublesome Starter Drive Adapter. It may also save weight and move the Center of Gravity aft.Work with your service centerIf your engine is in Warranty, then go ahead and have the NEW Starter Drive Adapter supplied and installed by your Cirrus Service Center. Pursue this at the first signs of slippage, grinding or failure of the starter to engage/disengage.If the SC or Cirrus fails or refuses to acknowledge or remedy the problem ensure that you have formally reported the early indication and have the SC acknowledge your report in writing. Some may decide it prudent to have the starter drive removed, disassembled, inspected and the tolerances checked at their own expense to rule out or catch the failure early.Overhauling starter driveOut of warranty, overhauling your own starter drive adapter or obtaining an exchange overhauled Starter Drive Adapter (Aircraft Specialties Services, Tulsa OK , or G&N Aircraft, Inc., Griffith, Indiana) may be a much better option than buying a new unit from TCM or Cirrus for the following reasons:1. Quality Control. The author of this article has personally witnessed three starter drive adapters with visible manufacturing defects as supplied by TCM through Cirrus. It is worthwhile to consider that these assemblies are put together in a factory assembly line environment. Although reasonable precautions are likely employed by the manufacturer, there are enough failures to consider their effectiveness. Tolerance stacking of individual parts within the assembly can become a factor.Many quality accessory overhaul shops have a ?€?Santa?€?s Workshop?€? approach to their work and are inclined to carefully measure tolerances on the assembled unit. Do not be worried that the part is ?€?used?€?. It is also proven and inspected. Each individual completed assembly bears an FAA Approved Repair Station Airworthiness Tag signed by an actual person licensed by the FAA with Inspection Authorization.2. Price. The price of a TCM OEM Starter Drive Adapter through Cirrus Design is US$2,695.57 (SR20, P/N646220-A53S, price as of Aug. 2005). The overhaul/exchange price from an accessory overhauler is approx $900 provided your core is serviceable. See: Aircraft Specialties Services(Must use their approved starter to have a warranty), or G&N Aircraft, Inc..Time to Remove and Replace the Starter and Drive Assembly is Approximately 3 hours from cowling off to cowling on.Basic Operation ExplanationThe Teledyne Continental Motors (TCM) engines powering Cirrus aircraft are started by various 24VDC (24 volt direct current) electric motor that are indirectly coupled to the crankshaft of the engine through a spring clutch starter drive adapter.The electric motor is energized through a starter relay located in the MCU (Master Control Unit). When the ignition key is turned to the START position, a low current control circuit is completed to the low power side of the starter relay/solenoid.This power from the ignition switch energizes an electro-magnetic coil which when energized, completes the high power circuit to the electric starter motor.As the starter motor is not directly connected to the engine, when this starter motor turns, it causes a coil spring to tighten around a splined drum on the drive shaft. This shaft is connected to a right angle pinion gear which in turn transfers the rotational energy directly to the engine?€?s crankshaft.When the ignition key is released, the electric motor is no longer powered and is relatively free to turn in either direction. The output drive of the electric motor is however still coupled to the coil spring.Without the forward rotation of the electric motor, the tension in the coiled spring is now no longer being applied to the splined drum shaft. The spring attempts to return to its natural shape and thereby release the grip on the splined drum drive shaft.There is a much more detailed explanation posted by Kent Felkins in the COPA Forum It has been edited and included at the end of this page for those interested in the nitty gritty details.ProblemsThis direct gear drive starting system on our TCM engines is not without significant durability issues.These issues are not unique to the Cirrus installation.The primary problem occurs with excessive wear between the drive shaft drum and the square wire coil spring.The maximum serviceable clearance limit between these parts is 0.003?€?When this interface becomes too large through wear or otherwise becomes distressed, the rotational energy from the electric motor cannot be delivered to turn the engine?€?s crankshaft.This excessive clearance can be caused by (among other things):1. Failure of the clutch spring to disengage fully and immediately after engine starting. This causes metal to metal wear and excess heat which may reduce the hardness of the wear surfaces and/or reduce the spring tension.2. Out of Tolerance Machining and/or Tolerance Stacking. The tolerances on the shaft/drum and the spring are very tight. Springs are difficult to machine accurately, hence the use of a square shouldered wire spring. Tolerance Stacking occurs when one part (say the drum) meets the specification at the minimum end of the allowable outside diameter tolerance and the mating part (the spring) is at the maximum outside diameter specification. Once mated, the two tolerances can be very close to the clearance limit and only a minor amount of wear can cause the tolerance to become out of limits.The original author has seen and replaced a new TCM starter drive adapter that had undamaged surfaces that were (visibly to the naked eye) not parallel.3. Excessive Torque/Speed of the Electric Starter Motor. The permanent magnet starter motors can deliver an incredible amount of instantaneous power. Some believe that this power may simply overwhelm the ability of the friction interface between the spring and drum to the mass of the reciprocating engine parts. This suggests that slipping, if inevitable, would be accelerated by the use of the high powered/geared electric motors. Cold weather and a lack of warm oil between the bearing surfaces in cold weather operations (without pre-heat) may exacerbate this slippage. This suggests that the lower torque of the ?€?old?€? technology Prestolite starter motor may cause less starter drive wear and contribute to a longer life of this drive assembly.Collateral Damage to the Aircraft?€?s Electrical System can occur if the electric starter motor remains engaged in normal engine operation. The starter motor is now driven by the engine and becomes an unregulated high power direct current generator.Other starting system problems may occur as a result of low battery power.If the starter solenoid receives insufficient power from the battery it may produce a rapid clicking or clacking sound. This sound is the electromagnet failing to fully engage. This will prevent delivery of power to the starter motor.System VariationsStarter Drive Adapter Available only from the OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer) TCM.There are two styles of Right Angle Starter Adapters made by TCM?€?New Style?€? introduced mid 2005 ?€?Old Style?€?Electric Starter Motors Several available and approvedIn order of the original authour?€?s preference:Sky-Tech C24 ST3 http://www.skytecair.com/Continental.htmConsidered a ?€?lightweight?€? starter @ 6.5 lbs Permanent Magnet Motor Latest and most advanced electric starter motor available for this engine.

So I offer this info. Standard disclaimer applies, I have no financial interest.Aircraft Specialties Services, of Tulsa Oklahoma, supplies rebuilt adaptors and approved replacement parts in addition to other engine parts.There are two designs of TCM right-angle start adaptors. An old style and new style. 95% of the ones in the field are old-style.Recently, they conducted tests by installing a cut-away old-style adaptor housing on a test cell engine that allowed filming of the adaptor mechanism while the engine started and continued running.The results show that some brands of lightweight motors keep the adaptor mechanism engaged much longer than suspected and thus subject to engine loads.Some instances, the mechanism did not fully release drag until the engine reached 2000 rpm or more. Yes, two thousand rpm.A detailed description of the operation is long and I can provide to those interested if you contact me. Many may have a understanding of the mechanism already.Briefly, the electric starter motor turns a shaft with a small worm gear that engages a larger brass gear which is connected to heavy square coil clutch spring. The clutch spring winds up to constrict around a drum area of the output shaft which is directly geared to the engine.It is essential that clutch spring relaxes and releases from the drum after engine start, or the engine forces will not be isolated from the adaptor mechanism. This adaptor drag will cause high temperatures and distress of the spring and drum.The worm gear that engages the brass gear is keyed to its shaft but it can slide along the length an amount to absorb shock loads and allow the mechanism to relax after engagement.The films show that the worm gear will engage the brass gear in the lower quadrant, then perhap move to the middle or upper quadrant. It depends upon turning resistance and spring forces.The worm gear has to disengage completely for the mechanism to relax and allow the clutch spring to unwind, and may be inhibited from doing so by a starter motor with high turning resistance . There is a return spring on the shaft to assist the worm gear to disengage. Actually there are two part numbers, a stiff and a weaker spring. The effects of both were tested.A simple illustration field test is to remove the electric starter motor then use a large screwdriver to turn the input shaft until the crankshaft moves. (Note the arrow imprinted in the casting to show direction.) You will feel the mechanism windup as it takes up spring slack. When you remove the screwdriver, the input shaft will quickly spin in the opposite direction a few revolutions.Aircraft Specilaties measured the free shaft turning force of:Sky-Tech C24 ST3 - 1-2 in-lbs.Prestolite 4003 ?€? 3 - 4 in-lbsDelco-Remy 1109694 - 6-7 in-lbs.Lamar PM 1207 - 7-8 in-lbs.Iskra 655565 - 10-11 in-lbs.If you can turn the shaft with your fingers, it needs less than 6 inch-pounds.Installation of each brand on the test engine brought a few surprises.None allowed mechanism disengagement after simple engagement of the starter if the engine did not actually start. So that is to say that if you turned the engine over and it did not start, the starter drive spring is still engaged.All needed the vibration of the engine running for complete dis-engagement of the worm gear from the brass gear.Several of the motors would not allow dis-engagement of the starter drive spring until the engine reached 20000 rpm!In the test, the engine was shut down at 2000 rpm and the remaining adaptor drag was measured by the amount of torque needed to relax the mechanism.The Results clearly indicate the starters which would be likely to cause the least amount of residual drag and wear to the adapter.In order of performance the first two units performed equally:- Prestolite had released completely with either the weak or stiff worm gear return spring installed. - Sky-tech also released completely with either the weak or stiff spring. - Delco-Remey released completely with the stiff spring. The weak spring required 25 inch-pounds of drag to disengage - Lamar had 44 in lbs remaining with stiff spring and 48 in-lbs. with weak - Iskra finished last and had 45 in-lbs/stiff and 54 in-lbs/weak drag remaining.It is considered that long-term normal wear occurs during the time the engine first fires and the starter motor remains engaged. This is the time when there is direct link of the mechainism from starter motor to engine forces.Examples of failures caused by 'hung' starter occurrences include;When the electric motor remains fully engaged and powered after engine start, starter drives have shown very high temperature distress of the clutch spring, galling of the shafts and heavy coking. One example had the middle coils of the spring melted away.Myself, I consider an adaptor inspection mandatory if a hung starter occursMine is SN374 and am on my third (now out of warranty) starter adapter in approx. 300 hours. I tried also under warranty to get the heavy replacement but no go under warranty.If the starter slips any at all on engine start up it is a bad thing and time to head for the shop. It won't get any better.I'm not sure but it seems like a tell-tale sign of a starter going bad on these engines is when you move the prop, like getting it out of the way for your tow, you can heard a kind of grinding noise.As a data point, when my first adapter was going bad, it was slipping rather badly, but intermittently. I couldn't get it replaced under warranty, as the SC could not duplicate the problem. Like my word wasn't enough.I left it there an extra day. When I went out to get the plane the next day, it wouldn't start. The SC mechanic heard me out on the ramp grinding away, and fixed it. This was at about 60 hours and at that time I wasn?€?t aware of how serious the consequences of not handling this right away could be.This issue can result in big chunks of metal in the oil supply.At this time , if you have the old-style adaptor,the conclusion is to use the Prestolite, or switch to a Sky-Tech.The new style adaptors are only for the 2:1 ratio versions. The input shaft's clutch drum area is smooth but has a couple of oil holes, akin to a crankshaft journal.The clutch spring appears the same at first glance but is of smaller coil thickness for more flexibilty. The spring fits over the drum with a interference fit, versus the old which had some tolerance. One end of the spring is NOT constrained in a sleeve or cup as the old was. Understand that the new spring rides on the smooth shaft on a hydrodynamic oil film. How does it grab to crank the engine? Any coil spring twisted in direction of its coils will become smaller diameter, and twisted opposite will enlarge. The output shaft that is geared directly to the engine is always turning, but in direction relative to the spring that enlarges it. The engine stopped, the starter motor turns the spring faster of course and the first bit of coil grabs the drum then the rest of the spring winds up and constricts, thus grabbing and turning the output shaft.Aircraft Specialties has said that the new style shafts show very little wear. However, there have been hints that the new more flexible spring may not be as robust for some engine versions.Other COPA Forum Discussions regarding the Starting System:Cirrus ?€?working on solution?€? in 2002 ?€?I'm on my third starter adapter (13 months old, 148 hours).

Common problem.?€?Member CommentsI ordered a stock rebuilt unit from Aircraft Specialities Service(800 826-9256) and returned my core; total cost was $675. Their customer service is quiet friendly, ask for Julian.BTW,I shopped a couple of companies but ASS's price was the best by far.you need to determine whether your starter is weak or whether your starter adapter is slipping. When the prop stops turning while attempting to start, listen carefully to determine whether or not you can hear the starter motor turning. If the starter is turning but the prop isn't, then you have a slipping starter adapter. If the starter isn't turning, then you have a weak starter.I do not recommend the Skytec ST3 for IO-550 engines. They work okay for some owners, but many report that the Skytec simply is not strong enough to start a -550 engine reliabily. For smaller engines (like the -470s), it seems to be okay.My recommendation is to use a (non-lightweight) direct-drive starter like a Delco-Remy or a TCM Energizer. Avoid the lightweight TCM/Iskra starter like the plague.",03:59:00,Friday
Powerplant maintenance,3,TCM fuel control unit,https://www.cirruspilots.org/copa/member/sr_aircraft/w/copapedia/382.tcm-fuel-control-unit.aspx,No, Roger Whittier,2014-05-16,0,"It's important to understand how a TCM fuel control unit works.The fuel control unit (FCU) consists of two valves connected in series. To get to the cylinders, the fuel travels from the outlet of the engine-driven fuel pump, then through the two valves in the FCU in sequence, and then to the fuel distributor valve (""spider"") on top of the engine where it gets divided up into 6 equal substreams that go to the six fuel injector nozzles.When fuel enters the FCU from the engine-driven pump, it first goes through the first valve which is controlled by the mixture control (red knob). This valve is a proportioning valve, which determines what percentage of the fuel will go to the engine, and what percentage will be returned to the fuel tank. When the mixture is full rich, this valve sends all available fuel to the engine and none back to the pump. When the mixture is in idle cutoff, the valve sends no fuel to the engine and all fuel back to the pump. (To be 100% correct, make that ""almost all"" and ""almost none."") At intermediate mixture control settings, the valve sends some fuel to the engine and returns some fuel to the pump, according to the mixture control position.Fuel that the mixture valve sends to the engine then goes through the second valve in the FCU. This valve is controlled by the throttle. It is not a proportioning valve, but acts more like the valve on a faucet. At full throttle, it allows fuel to pass without much resistance. As throttle is retarded toward idle, it provides an ever-increasing constriction to fuel flow, causing a pressure drop and reducing the fuel pressure at the flow divider.The bottom line of all this is that if the mixture is in idle cutoff, almost all fuel from the pump is returned to the pump, and almost none gets to the throttle valve in the FCU. Therefore, throttle position makes almost no difference.",03:40:00,Friday
Powerplant maintenance,3,Vibration analysis,https://www.cirruspilots.org/copa/member/sr_aircraft/w/copapedia/383.vibration-analysis.aspx,No, Roger Whittier,2014-05-16,0,"Most (well over 95%) props are not within the industry limits of .2 IPS (inches per second) Prop/crankshaft assembly imbalance is the easiest corrected imbalance in the engine. It's also very noticeable in the airframe to most users. The next vibration source is cylinder to cylinder produced variations in combustion vibration. These are caused by air and/or fuel imbalances, ignition system variances and mechanical anomalies. The vibrations felt by incomplete or erratic combustion process is the most unnerving vibration to a pilot/crew/passenger. I have noted a large variance in combustion rate levels, some correctable with fuel nozzle flow rates, others ignition and some mechanical. ( I can show you what you feel when you perform a mag check and which cylinder(s) or magneto is influencing the drop/mag split or vibration level change) Blade passage rate of the propeller (two or three blade) produces an excitation force that is also very prevalent felt vibration, three blade props ""feel"" smoother as the air pulse Hz is higher than a two blade and usually with less force per blade passage. Engine installation issues can transmit vibration to the cabin just like a record player needle arm. Another issue with aircraft that have the exhaust exit just below the cabin floor is the expansion of combustion gases at the exit point at the 125 to 135 Hz range, (floor mats well fitted, may reduce the felt levels) Having a spectrum analysis of your aircraft inflight or on ground can give valuable data to help limit vibration sources and transmission paths.

Replacement parts,3,Battery replacement - 24v BAT1/2,https://www.cirruspilots.org/copa/member/sr_aircraft/w/copapedia/405.battery-replacement-24v-bat12.aspx,No, Peter Storer,2014-05-19,1,"The supplied #1 battery for the SR22 is a wet cell Gill 243. A typical life for the Cirrus supplied Gill Wet cell batteries is 2.5 years. You can find the Gill service manual at http://gillbatteries.com/battery_PDF/Flooded_Service_Manual.pdfThe supplied #2 batteries for the SR22 are Yuasa NP7-12, a common battery available through a number of online vendors.ContentsBatteries 101Replacement Options - AGMMember CommentsBattery Pulse DesulfatorsBattery #2Batteries 101We abuse our batteries. They operate at temperatures well above the specifications. We don't fly long enough to completely recharge the battery. We tend to discharge the battery to do software updates without the engine running. Shops hurt the battery to check something without external power hooked up. Aircraft batteries by nature are just barely large enough to do the Job. They have little grace in the capacity. Compare it to a automobile battery with a 100 AMP Hour Rating. That means a auto battery is capable of 1,200 watts for 1 hour (100amps x 12 vdc = 1200 watts hours. Your airplane battery has only 240 watts for 1 hour (10amps x 24vdc = 240 watts hours). Just 10 minutes of sitting with the switch on will consume 60 watts ( 10/60 x 24 vdc x 15 amps=60 watts or 25% of your capacity. Then if you don't go flying to recharge the battery and let it sit for many days or weeks you allow the battery plates to crystallize. Crystallization occurs at a greater rate when a battery is not fully charged. The very worse thing you could do is run the battery dead then walk away not charging it for days. A dead battery will need a complete recharge that will take many hours. If you let a shop quick charge your battery it may overheat and warp the cells. (Sealed batteries have lower maximun charge rates). After about two weeks it is toast. If you fly for a short time then your battery will not fully charge which aids crystallization. Very cold batteries provide less power. One last abuse, we shake them, there is nothing good about engine vibration.So if you wonder why your battery does not last very long it is our fault.There is a process to test your battery's capacity. The Gill manual calls for inspection at 800 +/- 50 hrs or 11 +/- 1 months after installation which ever comes first, then every 400 +/-25 hrs or 6+/-1 months.They also say the test should should confirm you have 80% of rated capacity to be airworthy which breaks down to a 10amp constant load for 48 minutes with the the total voltage not dropping below 20 volts.No testing is listed in the Cirrus manual for your annual and most shops won't do the test unless you ask, so the so called ""airworthy"" is Gill's opinion for their batteryYou can do a simple voltmeter test. It will give you a general measurement of your batteries health. Check the voltage after the plane has been sitting at least 4 hours and preferable over night. Don't wait too long as the charge will bleed off over time. 100% - 26.0 volts, 90% - 25.9 volts, 80% - 25.7 volts, 70% - 25.5 volts, 60% - 25.3 volts, 50% - 25.1 volts,Replacement Options - AGMAviation Consumer (Jan 2004) recommends the Concorde AGM battery (dry cell) over the Cirrus supplied Gill wet cell battery. The AGM battery is maintenance free, and discharges at 1/3 the rate of wet cell batteries. AGM - absorbed glass mat. The Concorde RG24-15M battery is STC'd for the Cirrus under STC#01304WI; FAA-PMA Supplement #76. Also specified for Concorde RG24-11M, CB24-11M, and CB24-11MXC. Direct no hassle installation with only logbook entry. The AGM version in the Gill line is the 243-S, which members have had positive experience with.Member CommentsI'm not sure that 2+ years is all that bad for an airplane battery. That said, I also went through batteries fairly frequently in my SR20 - primarily because I was too lazy to frequently take the cowl off, open the battery cover, and check the fluid. When the battery fluid gets low, it's really not good for the battery's life! I have since had my battery replaced by a sealed unit - in my case it was the Concorde, though Gill also makes one - and, because it doesn't require maintenance, I'm hoping that my laziness will not contribute to a shortened battery life. Might be worth looking at a sealed unit if you also do not check your battery as frequently as you should...I spoke to the Gill battery representative at AOPA because my battery just went dead at 22 months. (And the FBO charged $716 to replace it.) The Gill representative suggested the battery should last 3-4 years but suggested putting a charge on it every couple of months even when the plane is being used on a regular basis.-Gary SymkoviakMy battery (SR20) died today after 2 yrs 4 months service. I had to shell out $220 more bucks to the SC as opposed to Aircraft Spruce. I will replace at 2 yrs next time.So, the -15M has 24% more reserve capacity than the -11M and a whopping 36% more than the original Gill G-243. So one hour of Gill 243 BAT 1 operation might be extended to one hour and TWENTY minutes with a Concorde RG24-15M. Nothing comes without a price and the Concorde RG24-15M weighs (29.5Lbs) 1.5 lbs more than the OEM G243 (28 lbs). If you want to save weight the RG24-11M weighs 26.5 lbs so there is a 1/5 lb savings. The -11M still ahs 10% more reserve capacity than the G 243 though. Finally, I'm going to shill for a really decent place to buy stuff including this battery and that is from John Schwaner at Sacramento Sky Ranch.At my second Annual my highly-respected SC recommended that I try to go another year with my battery because I had never had the slightest problem and my plane is kept inside. I appreciated their effort to help me economize. Three months later, the battery cracked and started leaking acid. Now armed with 20/20 hindsight, if I had it to do over again, I would replace it at two years.The -15 has greater capacity than the -11, and the price is only slightly more than the -11. At Advanced Power: RG24-11M $290.98 RG24-15M $306.48my Gill 243 just crapped out on me this past weekend after two years ten months in service. My local non-cirrus FBO wanted $300 just to do a capacity test on the battery, and $480 for a replacement, plus installation cost and tax. I passed on that idea. The advice I got from everyone I spoke to was that with nearly 3 years service I should just go ahead and replace it.I was considering the Concorde RG24-15M, which was $406 from the local distributor, including tax. I ended up ordering the Gill 243S, which was $311 from Aircraft Spruce. There is no tax and they include shipping from GeorgiaI just bought a Concorde RG24-15M battery. It was $340.97 including California sales tax.$300 for testing the battery is out of line. You can basically buy a new one for that (and add the sales tax).When you put in the new battery be especially careful not to short out the terminals. The Concorde folks did that when they put in my aircraft and had to run for a replacement battery.Just replaced Gill#243 (wet, not sealed type) after aprox 4years in service.

Cost was $151 each for two Michelin Aviat 15X600-6 tires ($302.00), 2.5 hours of labor @ $75/hr ($187.50) and $2.06 for miscellaneous small parts for a total of $491.56. New Michelins for our planes at Dresser (Gordon posted a link to them) are $113.00 each and their branded Butyl tubes are just under $40.00. For some reason I could not find the Goodyear tires - maybe not in stock right now. Replacing tires is a permitted owner maintenance activity - if your up to the task. If not, it does take a while and you should plan 2 or 3 hours - have to pull all that fairing...Also put in the Airstop or Butyl tubes. You will love not having to put air in them as often. I have always had good luck with Goodyear Flight Custom II with the airstop tubes. Like others, I have always purchased tires from Dresser - very good service.""Not surprisingly when you know a bit about tires, the Desser retread comes highly rated by AvConsumer.""You will be surprised to see that retreads are actually safer. Tires are more likely to fail early in life--if they don't succumb to infant mortality, they probably will last until the tread wears down. Meanwhile, failed carcasses never get recapped. Only those that make it to a ripe old age get selected, and tires can be recapped only once. So, the evidence supports the notion that recapped tires are safer than new ones.rPersonally, I find the risk of new tires to be unacceptable!this morning during my preflight I noticed exposed cord on the left main tire. The exposed area was about 6 or 8 inches long. After moving the plane I noticed a shorter area of exposed cord on the right main tire.rN252P has 312 hours and 436 landings. It turns out that it also has about 1/2 mile drag. rFriday we landed at Palm Beach (PBI) around lunch time and parked at Signature. The line guy asked how long we would be there and we told him until about 10 o'clock that night. He said that he would not have to move us and that I could set the parking brake. That night when we arrived to get in the plane we found that it had been moved (dragged) to the tie down area.I have just over 400 hours (don't know the number of landings) on my original tires - very little sign of wear. If you tires are wearing normally, the wear will be even around the tires (although the inside edges will wear out first if you don't rotate them). Having areas like you describe indicate either landing with the brakes locked - or being dragged as you suggest. (BTW, I never leave my plane anywhere with the brakes locked, If I am on a sloped ramp, I may lock them until I get it chocked and tied down - then release them). Goodyear Flight Custom III is a top-of-the-line, very long wearing tire. Some like Michelin Air, but my experience is they don't wear quite as well, and cost is the same as the III's.Cost is about $115 per tire...mains and nose...from Desser Tire (1-800-247-8473). Be sure to order new ""leakguard"" tubes to go with the new tires.If you're on a budget (what, someone with a Cirrus on a budget?) you may want to consider the Desser retreaded tires. The airlines use them, flight schools use them, and many individual owners use them. Cost is about $50 each. I just put Goodyear Flight Custom III's on my 22 (all three). It was about $450 for all three with tubes and shipping. So far I have been happy with them, but then I have not had them long so its premature to say much else. I have had good luck with II's before. I did have a set of Michelins on it before this and have to agree - they seemed to wear out a little faster. Impression, did not track landings. Desser is also my tire supplier of choice, normally. Although when I bought mine they were in short supply due to a strike at the GY factory so I ended up buying them elsewhere. I will go back to Desser though. They have a nice website, try http://www.desser.com/.I just put Good year III's on and paid $109 ea at the SC in Naples Fla... a good tire...I'm pleased with it.Whatever tire you select, be absolutely sure to use the new synthetic tubes. They hold air 5 times longer than the older rubber ones.Tires are a fairly standard thing. rYou can buy them (or just check price) at Aircraft Spuce tire chart. Then just have your mechanic put them on.rhttp://www.aircraftspruce.com/catalog/lgpages/tirestubesappchart.phpMains are 15 x 6.00-6 and the nosewheel is a 5.00-5Both are six ply.The mains are not a common tire so not always so readily available. Plan ahead a week or two to ensure your shop doesn't get surprised.Having looked into the Michelins, Goodyears and Dessers I'd say that the Desser Monster Retreads are the best tire. Not just the cheapest but the best.If you think about it, the tire carcass that Desser uses has been proven and very VERY closely inspected before it has been retreaded. Maybe closer than a factory made tire.It has more meat in the way of tread so will wear longer. Diameter is not a concern as they must comply with the spec and our wheelpants are pretty open anyways.Having said that we put on the new Goodyears after 800 hours.  Michelins don't ahve the same tread thickness as the Goodyears.Rotating the main tires whenever uneven tread wear is noticed will help to extend the life of them on our spring gear aircraft. Just one rotation in the life will go a long way. After that I think it is cost effective any longer.And as everyone has already said, get the new tubes!Best deal on the market is Desser Monster Retreads. Much less than new tires, actually better-wearing, and no fit problems (even with retractables like mine). 5.00/5 and 5.00x5 are synonymous, but in addition to those dimensions you'll need to specify the correct ""ply rating"" (e.g., 4PR or 6PR).If you're replacing tires, be sure to replace the tubes as well. Reusing a tube when changing a tire is an invitation to trouble. Buy the Michelin leak-stop tubes; stay away from the Desser house-brand tubes. rAt least one owner has reported on the COPA forum that because of the geometry of the main gear legs, the outboard portion of the tire touches down first - therefore it is worthwhile to have the tires rotated to equalize wear and extend their life.",22:37:00,Friday

Scheduled Maintenance,3,Annual Inspections,https://www.cirruspilots.org/copa/member/sr_aircraft/w/copapedia/398.annual-inspections.aspx,No, Roger Whittier,2014-05-16,0,"Most aircraft owners contemplate the upcoming annual inspection on their aircraft with more than a little concern over what may be found and how much the inspection is going to cost. One technique for reducing the risk of a major shock when the bill is presented at the end of the process is to go into the inspection aware of what it entails, what the owner's rights, responsibilities and obligations are and the role of the maintenance technician conducting the annual inspection and repairs.ContentsOwner ResponsibleInspect and then StopRepairs and Return to ServiceDisagreementsFirst Flight Following MaintenanceOwner ResponsibleThe Federal Aviation Regulations place the responsibility for maintenance of the aircraft on the owner or operator, in the case of a Cirrus, the owner is usually also the operator, and is responsible to assure that all maintenance is done in accordance with the regulations. Therefore, the maintenance technician performing an annual inspection is working for, and under the direction of, the owner/operator, and decisions regarding the annual inspection are to be made by the owner/operator.FAR 91.409 http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr&sid=ee0d1a682d03473b874f84fde8811681&rgn=div5&view=text&node=14:2.0.1.3.10&idno=14#14:2.0.1.3.10.5.7.5 sets out the requirement for an inspection every twelve calendar months. Therefore, if an annual inspection was conducted on September 14, 2007, the inspection would be effective through September 30, 2008. Some owners prefer to start the subsequent annual inspection at the very end of the month, so that it is completed and signed off at the beginning of the next month, giving themselves a little longer between annual inspections. There is nothing contrary to the regulations in this practice.The annual inspection, as described by the FAA, is only an inspection. It must be conducted by a mechanic with an Inspection Authorization, who also must sign off the inspection. It must be conducted in accordance with either the manufacturer's published procedures or alternative procedures approved by the FAA so long as they cover the areas set forth in the FARs. See: the Cirrus Design SR22 Maintenance Manual procedure for the annual inspection checklist.Any discrepancies found during the inspection are to be resolved prior to returning the airplane to service. Depending on the discrepancies found, the repairs and sign off for return to service may be conducted by an A & P rated mechanic or the owner of the airplane.Inspect and then StopWhen the appointment is set up for the annual, the owner should discuss the procedure with the mechanic, explicitly pointing out that work is to stop once the inspection is completed and a list of discrepancies is put together by the IA. The discrepancy list should never be entered into the aircraft logbooks, the FAA makes that clear in FAR 43.11(a)(5). http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr&sid=ee0d1a682d03473b874f84fde8811681&rgn=div8&view=text&node=14:1.0.1.3.20.0.363.8&idno=14When the airplane is brought in for the inspection, the owner should again discuss the procedure with the mechanic, that the inspection will take place and the discrepancy list provided to the owner for discussion before any further work is authorized.The mechanic should then open up the aircraft, cleaning the interior and exterior while doing so, as called for in the inspection procedures (yes, washing the airplane is part of an annual inspection), perform the physical inspection of the airplane, confirm that the aircraft paperwork is in compliance, research all applicable Airworthiness Directives and prepare a list of discrepancies. For a Cirrus aircraft this should take a maximum of two working days for one person.It is possible for an annual inspection to generate no discrepancies. This is an extremely rare occurrence. When such an event takes place, the maintenance technician simply closes up the airplane and signs off the annual inspection and approval for return to service. (The owner should then go out and buy a lottery ticket.)More commonly, a discrepancy list is generated. This should be presented to the owner for review and a discussion with the mechanic covering the repairs needed to return the airplane to service.Repairs and Return to ServiceOnce the discrepancy list is prepared the owner discusses it with the mechanic. Along with the list the mechanic should provide an estimate of the cost of parts and labor to perform each of the repairs. The mechanic will express his or her opinion as to what must be repaired for return to service. Ordinarily the owner will review the list and instruct the mechanic to go ahead with the repairs. If that is the case, the mechanic will undertake the repairs, perform routine preventive maintenance, close up the aircraft and sign off the annual by making the necessary maintenance entries in the airframe, engine and propeller logbooks.It may emerge that some discrepancies fall under preventive maintenance as defined in Part 43, and can be corrected by the owner. The owner can also make the logbook entry for those items. Yet other discrepancies may not have to be fixed. In such situations the component can simply be electrically isolated and placarded inoperative at the owner's discretion.The airplane is not legal to fly until the logbook entries have been made. The logbook entries are specifically a part of the inspection and return to service. Owners who have flown away from the annual inspection without having made sure the logbook entries were made (it is the owner's responsibility) have been subjected to certificate actions by the FAA.DisagreementsFrom time to time the owner/operator will disagree with one or more of the discrepancy items set out by the mechanic. If discussion does not resolve the disagreement, the owner has the option of instructing the mechanic to complete all other repairs except that one item and sign off the annual with the discrepancy. Per FAR 43.11(a)(5), the mechanic makes the following logbook entry: ""I certify that this aircraft has been inspected in accordance with (insert type) inspection and a list of discrepancies and unairworthy items dated (date) has been provided for the aircraft owner or operator.?€?The owner/operator then can take the airplane to another mechanic to have that discrepancy resolved. (That may require a ferry permit, as the airplane is not legal to fly.) That mechanic may be of the opinion that it is not a discrepancy and he can sign off the airplane for return to service following a review of the discrepancy sheet and examination of the airplane.First Flight Following MaintenanceBecause maintenance induced failures and infant mortality of components are a very real threat to safety, the first flight following maintenance, particularly an annual inspection in which the airplane has been opened up completely, should be solo, day VFR, within gliding distance of the airport.For further reading, see Mike Busch's article on annual inspections AVweb article as well as his other AVweb articles on maintenance.",02:54:00,Friday

Avionics operations,3,55x autopilot ILS coupled approach checklist,https://www.cirruspilots.org/copa/member/sr_aircraft/w/copapedia/55x-autopilot-ils-coupled-approach-checklist.aspx,No, Eharrison,2013-08-16,0,"ContentsrrUse autopilot for approachesTraining is a mustKeep approach stabilizedKeep ILS approaches coupledUse autopilot for approachesIn my humble opinion, there is no virtue in hand flying an instrument approach in IMC conditions, especially in a fast plane like the Cirrus. Its largely an artifact of the ancient training equipment and FAA test requirements that everyone is subjected to the macho experience of doing it by hand (under the hood, in VFR conditions) as the rite of passage into the land of IFR. But that is a poor simulation of the turbulent conditions that often exist when flying in real IMC. The autopilot is standard equipment in the Cirrus for a reason, and it is imperative that it be used to its fullest extent in single pilot IFR operations. If it isn't working, or the pilot isn't proficient in its use, then the pilot should either stay on the ground that day or find VFR conditions to land in.Training is a mustHaving had similar ""bad"" experiences to yours when first trying to do a coupled approach shortly after the basic training course in Duluth, I can safely say that the problem is with the pilot and not the autopilot. The UND training, intense as it is, just isn't enough to become totally proficient in how to do a coupled approach in IMC conditions. Having now done 30 approaches in IMC in my new Cirrus over the past six months (both precision and non-precision) I can offer the following suggestions:1. Slow down to 125 knots within 3 minutes of vectoring for the localizer: just pull the throttle back to just before the detent (19-20 inches MP) and it happens like magic. No flaps required or recommended.2. Within two miles of the localizer course, as you're on the 45 degree intercept angle, press Heading and Nav buttons simultaneously, and the AP will capture the course with great precision. Use the MFD in forward mode, scaled down to 10 miles, and its real easy to see the intercept point coming. Don't press the Approach button: it screws everything up. When done properly, the Garmin will automatically switch to VLOC mode as soon as the AP senses that the localizer needle is alive.3. Once the localizer needle comes alive and you're getting established on the localizer, start a quick descent to the glideslope intercept altitude (850 fpm). Otherwise, you'll be too high for the AP to properly intercept it. I usually pull the power back to 16 inches MP at this point, so that when it levels off I'm at 100-105 knots. Still no flaps.4. When the glideslope needle comes alive, and has descended to one notch above the intercept point, drop in 50% flaps and reduce power to 13.5 inches MP. The plane rises up to capture the glideslope and the AP quickly trims for a nice 95-100 knot approach speed. (I learned this technique from one of the Cirrus salesmen, and it works every time). If for some reason the AP hasn't captured the GS, then you can hit ALT twice to manually capture; if that doesn't work then disconnect the AP and hand fly it.Keep approach stabilizedThe point of these steps is to be in a stabilized mode at each point in the approach, with the power settings all worked out in advance so that there is no tinkering ""on the fly"". The most tricky part of an approach, I find, is anticipating the need to get down to the glideslope capture altitude, so that the AP has the requisite 10 seconds to anticipate the GS (see the POH supplement for details). It depends on the terrain and the instructions from ATC. Sometimes they'll have you at the GS intercept altitude all the way in, and other times you're 500 feet or more above it when getting established on the localizer.Once the GS has been captured, I fly the approach coupled all the way down to just above DH. I then disconnect, cut the throttle back to 10-11 inches and drop in 100% flaps. This quickly gets the speed down to 80 knots over the fence, and its a normal landing after that. Of course, if its still IMC at DH, its a missed approach so the autopilot must be disconnected anyway.Keep ILS approaches coupledAgain, I don't see the virtue in hand flying an ILS approach down to minimums. Sure, do all the practice hand flying you can tolerate in good to mediocre conditions, but when you're flying the real thing, why risk any imprecision? The FAA examiner for my IFR test (who flies 767s for United) told me that a coupled approach is mandatory for them in IMC conditions; and corporate jets certified for single pilot operation (Citation; Eclipse, one of these days) require a coupled autopilot for legal operation. It just makes sense to do the same thing in a fast single engine plane like the Cirrus.References:Original post by Ilan Reich",19:58:00,Friday

Avionics operations,3,Avionics theory,https://www.cirruspilots.org/copa/member/sr_aircraft/w/copapedia/avionics-theory.aspx,No, Eharrison,2013-08-16,0,"""(Note: this is a broad discussion of avionics in general, lifted from Wikipedia, not specific to Cirrus in any detail.)Avionics literally means aviation electronics. In essence it comprises all electronic systems designed for use on an aircraft. At a basic level this comprises communications, navigation and the display and management of multiple systems. It also comprises the literally hundreds of systems that are fitted to aircraft to meet individual roles. These can be as simple as a search light for a police helicopter or as complicated as the tactical system for an Airborne Early Warning platform.The study of avionics and its impact on aerospace technology has grown at an amazing rate. Initially the ancillary part of an aircraft, avionics has, for many aircraft, become the sole reason for its existence. Increasingly, military aircraft become the means of placing powerful and sensitive sensors into a tactical environment.ContentsrHistoryDesign constraintsIntegrationPhysical environmentElectromagnetic compatibility (EMC)VibrationSystem safetyQualityMain categoriesAircraft avionicsCommunicationsNavigationDisplaysAircraft flight control systemsCollision-avoidance systemsWeather systemsAircraft management SystemsMission or tactical avionicsMilitary communicationsRadarSonarElectro-OpticsESM/DASAircraft NetworksHistoryThe term avionics did not gain any credence or general use until the early 1970s. Up to this point instruments, radios, radar, fuel systems, engine controls and radio navigation aids had all formed individual and often mechanical systems. In the 1970s avionics was born. Driven by changes in the electronics industry as a whole, the avionics market boomed. However, where once aircraft and space flight set the standard, it was not long before the rest of the industry was in control. In the early 70s military aircraft consumed 90% of the world?€?s semiconductor production. By the mid 1990s it was less than 1%. Airframers started to bring together its specialists. They formed Avionics Departments and by the end of the 70s a whole new segment of the aviation industry had been formed.This was mostly driven by military need rather than civil airliner development (the cold war). A large number of aircraft had become flying sensors platforms, and making large amounts of electronic equipment work together had become the new challenge. Today, avionics as used in military aircraft almost always forms the biggest part of any development budget. It is roughly estimated that aircraft like the F-15E and the F-14 have 80% of their budget spent on avionics. Most modern helicopters now have budget splits of 60/40 in favour of avionics. The civilian market has also seen a massive growth in cost of avionics. Flight control systems (fly-by-wire) and new navigation needs brought on by tighter airspaces, have pushed up development costs accordingly. The major change has been the recent boom in consumer flying. As more people begin to use planes as their primary method of transportation, more elaborate methods of controlling aircraft safely in these high restrictive airspaces have been invented. Whilst the nature of civil aircraft means that avionics is almost always confined to the cockpit, the budgets and development made in the civil market has for the first time started to influence the military.Cirrus specificThere is a specific history to de  Cirrus Design range avionicsrThe original Cirrus SR20 was designed in 1997 with Trimble avionics ??, but once they were out of business, Airnav was chosen toghether with Garmin ??Design constraintsAny equipment fitted to aircraft has to meet a series of rigorous design constraints. The aircraft presents electronics with a unique and sometimes highly complex environment. Airworthiness and certification is one of the most costly, time consuming, troublesome and difficult aspects of building any aircraft. As aircraft and aircrew reliance on avionics has increased, it has placed a heavy duty of responsibility on the robustness of these systems. One necessary factor of constructing avionics systems is that a flight control system must be designed so that it never fails. However, degrees of this level of robustness can be found in every system fitted to aircraft.IntegrationThe means of connecting the vast array of systems together such that the information can be used in a cohesive and useful fashion have vexed the avionics industry from the start. The simplicity of a discrete wire telling a device that something is either on or off has grown all the way to the incorporation of fibre optic data buses moving flight control data around the aircraft. Ever more complex software has been written to ever more rigorous standards. Integration of systems into aircraft is one of the largest problems for engineers today. However small the aircraft, there is always some level of integration (whether or not it operates with the aircraft power supply, for example). The large aircraft projects (military and civilian alike) employ hundreds of engineers to integrate these complex systems.Physical environmentThe environment for any aircraft is different. Systems have many uses. Some need to be more robust than others. Today all avionics systems go through some level of environmental testing. This allows design authorities the ability to be assured of the robustness of the design.The testing comes in many forms, and has for many aircraft been pre-ordained by airframe manufacturers. As avionics became more ubiquitous on all sorts of aircraft, the Civil Aviation Authority|Airworthiness Authorities](e.g. UK United Kingdom Civil Aviation Authority|CAA or US FAA) set performance standards which equipment should meet. The manufacturers grew this to standards that define the environmental standards that the equipment should meet.These standards place upon the avionics manufacturers predefined methods and agreed levels of testing for aircraft parts. Things such as salt spray, waterproofness, mould growth, and effects of external contamination and so on are all tested for. Standards such as BS 3G 100, MIL-STD-810, DEF STAN 00-35 have all been written to provide manufacturers with these methods. Each individual test is assessed as to its usefulness on the item (e.g. salt spray tests may not need to be done on equipment housed inside sealed bays). Manufacturers maintain standards by cross referencing these standards and level of testing required; often generating top level general requirements. These do not dictate performance, but are an expression of the environment which the equipment must operate within.Electromagnetic compatibility (EMC)Also known as EEE, electromagnetic compatibility|EMC is an engineering activity that assesses the effect of one electrical electronic system on another. In the world of aircraft, EMC can cause all sort of problems, and equipments and aircraft are extensively tested using specific standards (Def Stan 59-41, MIL-STD-464]] etc.).VibrationFor even the most benign of aircraft (like an airliner), vibration is a serious issue as it has major impacts on reliability. On more aggressive aircraft like helicopters, vibration can be the major driver in the design. There are aircraft standards available for vibration, but many airframes do not recognise them. Vibration resonances will be different for almost every aircraft built, but they are certainly different for every type.System safetyAll parts of the aircraft are subject to regular system safety analyses. In avionics, methods for analysing the safety impacts of a system are dictated by airworthiness authorities of the individual nation. Invariably methods like one managed by the FAA or EASA (JAA) will be used for civilian aircraft. In the military world, whilst there are some world wide standards, lots of military purchasing authorities will dictate local standards (like Def Stan 00-56).The safety methodologies will significantly impact the design in terms of reliability and usage. Any system using software will be subject to even more scrutiny with respect to its safety impact.QualityThe procurement of avionics equipment is all part of a worldwide assortment of manufacturers. Whilst highly recognisable manufacturers will provide the parts for the 'insides' of a box or LRU (Line-replaceable unit), the specialist element of packaging, testing and managing the configuration of avionics falls into the domain of a few big players.Quality control of parts is a significant part of any major industry, but in avionics and aviation as a whole, supplier quality can break entire programmes (see the Boeing Chinook problems). Quality procedures dictated by ISO 9001 are now the starting blocks for any major business. However, all the main airframers have their own highly stringent quality procedures for delivery of documentation and hardware. It is often said that aircraft fly not on fuel, but on paperwork, since a single LRU (a radio or instrument) can produce excessive documentation.Main categoriesAvionics, like electronics, is a massive subject that does not easily lend itself to simple categorisation. The headings below try to allocate areas of interest, from which you can delve deeper into the subject areas.Aircraft avionicsThe cockpit of any aircraft is the most obvious location for avionics. It is also the most contentious and difficult. Systems that allow the aircraft to fly safely or have direct control over the aircraft are all directly controlled by the pilot. These safety critical systems and the items that support them are all referred to as aircraft avionics.CommunicationsProbably the first piece of avionics to exist, the ability to communicate from the aircraft to the ground has been crucial to aircraft design since its inception. The boom in telecommunications has meant aircraft (civilian and military) fly with a vast array of communication devices. A small number of these provide the critical air to ground communications systems for safe passage. On board communications are provided by public address systems and aircraft intercoms.Bands used for aircraft to aircraft and aircraft to groud communications are VHF 118.00 to 136.975, for long range (over water) HF equipment is usedNavigationThis article concerns navigation in the sense of determination of position and direction on or above the surface of the Earth.Soon after communications the envelope within which an aircraft could be operated was limited by the conditions. Navigation sensors have been developed from the early days to assist pilots in safe flight. As with communications, there is a vast array of radio navigation and relative aircraft based navigation devices that can be fitted to an aircraft.DisplaysThe advent of avionics as a separate entity was quickly followed by integration of these functions. The drive to manufacture more reliable and better quality means of displaying flight critical information to pilots started very early on. True glass cockpits have only started to come into being within the last 5 years. The introduction of LCD or CRT displays was often backed up by conventional instruments. Today the reliability of LCDs means that even these flight critical back ups are 'glass'.rBut this is only the superficial element. Display systems carry out checks of key sensor data that allows the aircraft to fly safely in very aggressive environments. Display software is often written in the same way as that for flight control software, as essentially the pilot will follow it. The display systems can take multiple different methods of determining attitude, heading and altitude that the aircraft use, and provide them in a safe and easy to use manner to aircrew.The main integration led to the development of AHDRSAircraft flight control systemsAeroplanes and helicopters have had different means of automatically controlling flight for many years. They reduce pilot workload at useful times (like on landing, or in the hover), and they make these actions safer by 'removing' pilot error. The first simple auto-pilots were used to control heading and altitude and had limited authority on things like thrust and flight control surfaces. In helicopters, auto stabilisation was used in a similar way. The old systems were all electromechanical in nature until very recently.The software driven systems fitted to almost all new major aircraft today have made a significant leap forward. The advent of fly-by-wire and electro actuated flight surfaces (rather than the traditional hydraulic) has massively increased safety. As with displays and instruments, critical devices which were electro-mechanical had a finite life which was very restrictive. Electronic systems are not limited by the mechanical constraints. With safety critical systems, the software is written in very strict conditions, where the ideal scenario is that it will never fail.Collision-avoidance systemsTo supplement air traffic control, most large transport aircraft and many smaller ones use a TCAS (Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance System), which can detect the location of other, nearby aircraft, and provide instructions for avoiding a midair collision. Smaller aircraft may use simpler traffic alerting systems such as TPAS, which are passive (they do not actively interrogate the transponders of other aircraft) and do not provide advisories for conflict resolution.To help avoid collision with terrain, aircraft use systems such as ground-proximity warning systems (GPWS), often combined with a radar altimeter. Newer systems use GPS combined with terrain and obstacle databases to provide similar alerting for light aircraft.Weather systemsWeather systems such as weather radar (typically Arinc 708 on commercial aircraft) and lightning detectors are especially important for aircraft flying at night or in Instrument meteorological conditions, where it is not possible for pilots to see the weather ahead.  Heavy precipitation (as sensed by radar) or lightning activity are both indications of strong convective activity and severe turbulence, and weather systems allow pilots to deviate around these areas.Recently, there have been three important changes in cockpit weather systems. First, the systems (especially lightning detectors like the Stormscope or Strikefinder) have become inexpensive enough that they are practical for light aircraft. Second, in addition to the traditional radar and lightning detection, observations and extended radar pictures (such as NEXRAD) are now available through satellite data connections, allowing pilots to see weather conditions far beyond the range of their own in-flight systems.  Finally, modern displays allow weather information to be integrated with moving maps, terrain, traffic, etc. onto a single screen, greatly simplifying navigation.Aircraft management SystemsAs integration became the buzzword of the day in avionics, and as PCs came onto the market, there was a natural progression towards centralised control of the multiple complex systems fitted to aircraft. Combined with displays and flight control systems, these three core systems allow all the aircraft systems (not just avionics) to have their data compiled and manipulated to make it easier to maintain, easier to fly and safer.Engine monitoring and management was an early progression into aircraft management for ground maintenance. Now the ultimate extension of this is total management of all the components on the aircraft, giving them longer lives (and reducing cost). Health and Usage Monitoring Systems (HUMS) are integrated with aircraft management computers to allow maintainers early warnings of parts that will need replacement.The aircraft management computer or flight management systems are used by aircrew in place of reams of maps and complex equations. Combined with the digital flight bag they can manage every aspect of the aircraft chock to chock. Although avionic manufacturers provide flight management systems, aircraft management and HUMS tend to be specific to the airframe as the design of the software is dependent on the aircraft it is fitted to.Mission or tactical avionicsThe major developments in avionics have tended to happen 'in the back' before the cockpit. Military aircraft have been designed either to deliver a weapon or to be the eyes and ears of other weapon systems. The vast array of sensors available to the military (as for the front) is then used for whatever tactical means required. As with aircraft management, the bigger sensor platforms (like the E-3D, JSTARS, ASTOR, Nimrod MRA4, Merlin HM Mk 1) have mission management computers.As the sophistication of military sensors increases and they become more ubiquitous, the pseudo-military market has started to dip into the product. Police and EMS aircraft can now carry some very sophisticated tactical sensors.Military communicationsWhile aircraft communications provide the backbone for safe flight, the tactical systems are designed to withstand the rigours of the battle field. Ultra high frequency|UHF, VHF Tactical (30-88 MHz) and SatCom systems combined with ECCM methods, and cryptography]] secure the communications. Data links like Link 11, k Link 16, Link 22 and Bowman (communications system)|BOWMAN, JTRS and even TETRA provide the means of transmitting data (such as images, targeting information etc.).RadarAirborne radar was one of the first tactical sensors. As with its ground based counterpart it has grown in sophistication. The obvious massive benefit of altitude providing massive range has meant a significant focus of developing airborne radar technologies. The general ranges of radar of Airborne Early Warning (AEW), Anti Submarine Warfare (ASW), and even Weather radar (Arinc 708) and ground tracking/proximity radar.The military has used radar in fast jets to help pilots fly at low levels. While the civil market has had weather radar for a while, there are strict rules about using it to navigate the aircraft.SonarSoon after radar came sonar. Dipping sonar fitted to a range of military helicopters allows the helicopter to protect shipping assets from submarines or surface threats. Maritime support aircraft can drop active and passive sonar devices (Sonobuoys) and these are also used to determine the location of hostile submarines.Electro-OpticsElectro-optic system covers a wide range of systems, including Forward Looking Infrared (FLIR), and Passive Infrared Devices (PIDS). These are all used to provide imagery to crews. This imagery is used for everything from Search and Rescue through to acquiring better resolution on a target.ESM/DASElectronic support measures and defensive aids are used extensively to gather information about threats or possible threats. Ultimately they can be used to launch devices (in some cases automatically) to counter direct threats against the aircraft. They are also used to determine the state of a threat or even identify it.Aircraft NetworksThe avionics systems in military, commercial and advanced models of civilian aircraft are interconnected using an avionics databus. These network protocols are similar in functionality as an in-home network connecting computers together, however, the communication and electrical protocols can be very different. Here is a short list of some of the more common avionics databus protocols with their primary application:rAircraft Data Network (ADN): Ethernet derrivative for Commercial AircraftAFDX: Specific implementation of ARINC 664(AND) for Commercial AircraftARINC 429: Commercial AircraftAvionics_Full-Duplex_Switched_Ethernet|ARINC 664]]: See ADN aboveARINC 629: Commercial Aircraft (Boeing 777)ARINC 708: Weather Radar for Commercial AircraftARINC 717: Flight Data Recorder for Commercial AircraftMIL-STD-1553: Military Aircraft""",19:59:00,Friday

The very positive is that the avionics provides all of the information the pilot needs for a safe and efficient flight, at his fingertips. A negative is that learning to get that information quickly and efficiently, and to do it without detracting from the other duties of flying the aircraft can be daunting. However, by systematically studying the systems, by possibly using one or more of the training aids available, and with practice, the Cirrus avionics can be easily mastered.Not all Cirrus aircraft come so ""fully equipped"", and earlier Cirrus aircraft have earlier variations of avionics that evolved to the current systems. Nevertheless, all Cirrus aircraft have sophisticated avionics, and are considered Technically Advanced Aircraft; all COPA Pilots face a training challenge with the avionics.Garmin GNS 430The heart of Cirrus avionics could be the Garmin GNS 430 GPS/VOR/LOC/GS/COM system. It has been said that if the 430 is mastered then learning the balance of the avionics easily follows. Or, more simply, the 430 can be difficult to learn. Fortunately the 430 is an extemely popular system and many pilots already have experience with it before they start flying Cirrus aircraft; but for those that are transition from other systems, and even for those already familiar with the 430, training aids are useful.The most popular training aid is the Garmin 430 Simulator that can be downloaded from Garmin. This is a PC version of the 430, packaged as a simple simulator, and it duplicates almost all the GNS 430 capability so you can train and learn the functions of the 430 from your desk or laptop.Here are four functions to know if there is an emergency during flight.The GNS430 has Terrain awareness as a software upgrade, using a terrain/obstacle database loaded on a datacard inserted in the second slot of the GARMIN GNS 430.

Avionics operations,3,Danger of using VS-ALT in low altitude IMC,https://www.cirruspilots.org/copa/member/sr_aircraft/w/copapedia/291.danger-of-using-vs-alt-in-low-altitude-imc.aspx,No, Roger Whittier,2014-05-14,0,"The VS-ALT (altitude preselect) feature on the S-Tec 55x autopilot is a very useful feature. It is activated by pressing and holding the VS button on the autopilot head followed by pressing the ALT button. As with other autopilot features the altitude preselect mode is driven by the PFD bugs.I recommend against using VS-ALT at low altitude while entering or in IMC, however. The slightest bump can cause you to press ALT before pressing and holding VS, or make you release pressure on VS while pressing ALT. The result is that the autopilot captures the present altitude and syncs the VS and ALT bugs on the PFD. A subsequent press of VS-ALT or just VS without resetting the bugs (which can happen by accident if it is bumpy or if the pilot is not paying what would probably be too much attention to pressing the autopilot buttons to the exclusion of all other things) will program the autopilot to descend rapidly, possibly into terrain or obstructions.It is a good idea to program all the bugs before takeoff, but ONLY engage VS mode at low altitude. After you are a suitable distance from terrain and workload is lower you can engage VS-ALT carefully.",06:08:00,Wednesday
Avionics operations,3,Database subscriptions,https://www.cirruspilots.org/copa/member/sr_aircraft/w/copapedia/292.database-subscriptions.aspx,No, Mike McCarthy,2015-05-01,0,"A Cirrus may have quite a few navigation databases; depending on the equipment there are updatable databases in the Garmin 430 GPS-Comms, the Avidyne MFD (or on older pre-PFD aircraft Arnav MFD and the Sandel HSI). The only legal requirement is, for IFR flying, to keep the Garmin databases current on a 28-day update cycle. Nothing is legally required to be updated for VFR flight.Each device has its own database; the data is not shared between devices. A separate update subscription or purchase is required for each device.The Garmin 430 subscriptions are available in a wide range of geographic coverage areas and the pricing varies from region to regionHere is a typical example of database subscriptions needed for a complete ""everything updated"" IFR aircraft with data covering the full USA ""48 states"" (annual prices as of June 2007):Garmin GNS400/500 series Dual Full USA Service (For two Garmin 430s) $430 (You cannot update two cards with a single subscription.)(Avidyne MFD NavData) MULTI-SVC INTERNET ""Americas"" (DAVD1357) $179 (discounted price with purchase of Dual or single Garmin svc.)Jeppview for MFD US 48 States rev svc (CMax approach charts plus paper enroute service) $839 ($100 software start-up fee.)Subsriptions with Jepp can be cancelled by you at any time, and a refund is prorated. This means that if you need the Eastern USA for a month, for example, you can subcribe and pay only for the portion you have the subscition activated.The Garmin 430s require a separately purchased ""Skybound USB"" card writer. Some owners update the cards on the 28 day cycles by removing them from the airplane and programming them. Other owners for convenience and backup buy a separate set of (expensive, proprietary) cards from Jeppesen and alternate the two sets.The Avidyne MFD requires two separate USB keychain stick type devices, one for CMax loading and one for Navdata loading (See Avidyne's website for ""approved"" devices, although many others will work. Memory devices must be formatted as FAT, not FAT32. Some memory devices are supplied with ""free software"" installed that prevents them from working on the MFD even if reformatted. See the forums for information.Jeppesen is transitioning to internet download only subscriptions. As of early 2007 most people seem to download the Garmin updates without difficulty although the CMax data is still provided on CDs as part of the subscription and downloading results have been sometimes erratic.The only source for the data is Jeppesen. This ?€?monopoly?€? is a source of spirited forum discussions.The older Arnav database update are available from Arnav directly. Cost is $298 (as of Nov 2007). Contact John Glazier at 253-848-6060.

A special terrain page, in the NAV group of pages, displays terrain information aircraft ground track and GPS-derived MSL (mean sea level) altitude.CFIT, ""Controlled Flight Into Terrain"", yet another acronym!  This one is a pilot killer, in VFR and mostly in IFR. According to American statistics CFIT is responsible for 17% of fatal general aviation accidents and occured in IMC in 50% of the cases.A few years ago GPWS was the way to fight back CFIT. Due to the cost very fews GA aircraft were equipped. With the advent of GPS, a new device recently appeared : the TAWS : Terrain Awareness and Warning System. TAWS is smarter than GPWS because it takes account of aircraft course not only aircraft instant hight over terrain. GPS gives position, a special database gives terrain and obstacle (in the USA) altitude, a software compute speed and aircraft course to provide alerts 30 or 60 seconds before a potential impact.The true TAWS, also called E-TAWS (E for enhanced) speaks: ""pull pull, sink sink etc"". The ""poor people's"" TAWS gives a visual alert, displaying a pop up on GPS screen. It's better than nothing, as well as the upgrade costs only $500 which is very cheap in aviation world....The understanding of the different alerts (and the strategy to follow on board) is not intuitive. You must have thought about it before, on the ground, so your inflight decisions will be immediate and adapted. Here is what I have understood :1. There is a color symbology to depict terrain information on the Terrain Page in Nav group of pages :Red : terrain is within 100' or above aircraft Yellow : terrain is within 1000?€? of aircraft altitude Black : terrain is more than 1000' below aircraft altitude2.There are two types of alerts : 1. RTC (Required Terrain Clearance) Alert : - course to come within minimum clearance values :- and the aircraft is currently above terrain :2. ITI (Imminent Terrain Impact) Alert: - course to come within minimum clearance values :- and the aircraft is currently below terrain :Pop-up are displayed during an alert when an alert is issued you can press CLR button and return to the currently viewed page  or press ENT button and display the TERRAIN pagePop-up displayed during an alert depends only on delay estimated before potential impact: 60 seconds : ""terrain advisory"" 30 seconds : ""terrain ahead"" if the delay is 30 seconds pop-up is flashingno difference between RTC and ITI...3. So we have to remember that there are 2 possibilities for TERRAIN Alerts : 1. RTC or ITI in 60 seconds : fixed pop-up ""terrain advisory"" 2. RTC or ITI in 30 secontes : flashing pop-up ""terrain ahead""4. Premature Descend Alerting (PDA)  During the final approach RTC/ITI alerts are automatically inhibited  Either the destination airport is picked up from Active Flight Plan, either the GNS use nearest airport to derive the destination if there is no active flight plan An algorithm sets a threshold for alerting :The system issues a Premature Descend Alert when the aircraft is below the normal approach :In my opinion in IMC the rule of thumb is:when you see a flashing alert, without trying to think you must:Climb and increase full powerPress ""enter"" to display the TERRAIN page and visualize the avoiding course:when you see the Premature Descent Alerting without trying to think you must:go around, i. e. climb and increase full powerpress ""clear"" then press OBS to execute the missed approach",10:43:00,Tuesday

Avionics operations,3,GNS430 Tips and Tricks,https://www.cirruspilots.org/copa/member/sr_aircraft/w/copapedia/293.gns430-tips-and-tricks.aspx,No, Roger Whittier,2014-05-13,0,"Here are some GNS 430 tips and tricks:ContentsTry This at HomeDisplaying a RadialIntercepting a Victor Airway from an Assigned RadialFlying a Radar Vector Departure ProcedureFlying a Vector with a Dead PFDTry This at HomeMeta-trick: Play with these tricks at home with the Garmin simulatorDisplaying a RadialA radial is a magnetic bearing extending from a VOR/VORTAC/TACAN navigation facility. To display a radial from a navigation facility (or indeed any waypoint), use any of the several methods to select a waypoint to navigate direct to and, while in the ""select direct waypoint"" screen, use the cursor to change the CRS (course) field to the desired radial.Example: You desire to navigate to the Mustang VOR (FMG) along the 095 radial. Press the DIRECT TO button; enter FMG into the waypoint field; move the cursor to the CRS (course) field and enter 095 as the course to the waypoint; activate. The GNS 430 and MFD will depict the 095 radial to the Mustang VOR and the autopilot can navigate this course.Trick: You can use the same procedure to display the final approach course to a runway. Displaying the final aproach course may help the pilot visualize the various legs of the pattern on the MFD.Intercepting a Victor Airway from an Assigned RadialSuppose - purely hypothetically - that you are at KCHO and you are given the (partial) clearance GVE GVE098 V16 ENO. You look at the low enroute chart L-22 and see that Victor 16 (at the point where you need to intercept it) is defined by R-238 off of the PXT VOR. The point where you are to intercept it is not a defined intersection though. Now you could always just do the intercept in the air - Time Turn Twist Throttle Talk - but wouldn't it be nice to have the whole route pre-loaded in the 430 before you leave the ground?This is easy to accomplish with a user waypoint. The point where you want to intercept Victor 16 is where the GVE R-098 intercepts the PXT R-238. In your flight plan you can just enter the name of a waypoint that doesn't exist: I usually use the Victor airway and a letter. In this case lets enter V16A. The GNS 430 will pop up the message that the waypoint doesn't exist (if it does exist you need to pick a different name) and ask if you want to create it. Say yes. In the screen that comes up fill in GVE 098.0 in the top REF WPT and RAD fields. Fill in PXT 238.0 in the bottom REF WPT and RAD fields. Ignore the DIS field. Move the cursor to Create and press Enter; you will end up with a user waypoint like the following:Viola, the point where you need to intercept V16 is now in your flight plan. (In order to follow V16, the next waypoint in your flight plan should be PXT VOR):Flying a Radar Vector Departure ProcedureRadar Vector and Obstacle Departure procedures are established departure procedures from an airport, using defined departure routes. These procedures are not referenced to a particular runway and thus are not in the Garmin 430 database.Take a look at this excerpt from the Fort Lauderdale Nine departure:If given this clearance: RV FLL9.THNDR VRB ....The pilot would review the procedure and note:The THNDR transition is based off of the DHP (Dolphin) VORThe clearance indicates the pilot will receive vectors to the transitionTo fly the departure, using all available resources, the pilot would:Enter DHP and THNDR in the flight planActivate the leg DHP-THNDR by Highlighting THNDR with the Cursor (While on the active flight plan page) and pressing the Direct button twice and then pressing ENTER.With the leg now active, The autopilot will be on heading mode; flying the vector assigned by ATC.Depress and hold the Heading button on the autopilot. Then, While still holding the Heading button, press the NAV button twice.The autopilot will now fly the heading bug until intercepting the DHP-THNDR course line. On intercept, the plane will turn toward THNDR and track the course and any subsequent waypoints. (VRB in this case)Flying a Vector with a Dead PFDHas your PFD malfunctioned in flight? Can't use the heading bug to fly an ATC-assigned vector on autopilot? Once you lose your PFD, the only lateral autopilot mode available to you is GPSS. That means the autopilot will always be flying a pre-set ground track. You might think that this means that an autopilot-flown vector isn't possible; but that isn't the case.You can use the +MAP waypoint to make the GNS430 fly a pseudo-vector. It is a pseudo-vector because you are telling the GNS430 to fly a ground track not a heading, but in a pinch with a dead PFD it acts a lot like a vector that you can fly with the autopilot in GPSS mode. The method only works when the GNS430 map is displayed in Track Up mode. While displaying the map page do the following: CURSOR - SPIN LITTLE KNOB RIGHT - move the BIG KNOB (left or right as appropriate) until the ground track you want is showing - DIRECT - ENTER - ENTER.Note: once you've started flying this vector and the autopilot has stabilized on a heading, you can check the heading with that wet compass thingy. If you have a strong crosswind and you need to tweak a few degrees left or right to get to the right magnetic heading, just repeat the trick but set your new ground track appropriately. If the wind changes you can tweak it again. It is important to realize that in GPSS mode you are flying a ground track not a heading, but it is simple to monitor the compass and tweak the ground track when necessary in order to get the magnetic heading you want.As with any avionics trick, fool around with this in VFR conditions (especially windy conditions to get the most out of the exercise) to see how it works.",09:34:00,Tuesday

Since 2003 all Cirrus have been equipped with Avidyne Entegra with a PFD.The Sandel SN3308 is an E-HSI, no more produced. It has been replaced by the Sandel SN4500. You can upgrade your SN3308 with a Sandel SN4500 but your aircraft has to be rewired...The Sandel SN3308 combines four functions in a three-inch instrument :- HSI - RMI - Moving Map and GPS annunciator - Stormscope display.Thanks to an halogen bulb, a high-intensity color image is projected in front of the device displaying navigation signal. You have to change the bulb every 225 hours or one year (whichever comes first).The situational awareness on the 3-inch display is amazing, worthy of an commercial aircraft EFIS system.In case of bulb blowing... :You can backup the heading information on the compass page of the Garmin.As long as the bulb is the only Sandel failure, then you can continue to use the autopilot in HDG mode. You can even SYNC to get the heading pointer slewed to your present heading.With the 55X autopilot in HDG mode, the autopilot gets info from the Sandel that uses the heading bug (orange) to determine desired course. In NAV mode, the autopilot gets info from the Sandel using course deflection voltages from either GPS or VLOC on Garmin #1, depending on the Garmin setting. With the 55X autopilot in NAV+GPSS mode, the autopilot gets info from the Garmin directly without reference to the Sandel in any way or concern for the GPS/VLOC setting on Garmin #1, since it gets digital data from the GPS navigator.So, if you suspect the Sandel, not only the bulb, you could try the heading bug and see if still works, and if that doesn't work, switch to NAV+GPSS mode and fly by making up GPS flight plans to get you where you want to go.On the Cirrus this device has some shortcomings :- the Sandel is very hard to read from the copilot side in daylight. - due to a too short harness, the connection between the Sandel HSI and the fluxgate could be broken.The symptom is an incorrect heading displayed on the Sandel. The HSI doesn't flag, no alarm is flashing, but the Sandel gives you invalid heading info. The error is often 30 degrees or more. On Cirri equipped with Avidyne MFD, your MFD gets its heading information from the Sandel, so your MFD will be wrong as well (some COPAins suggest going into the MFD set up and change the Heading info to be provided by the GNS430 n??1 instead of the Sandel to be displayed on the MFD ; by doing this you still have a valid heading bug on your MFD when the Sandel goes inop). Flying your autopilot in heading mode isn't going to work anymore.Most of the time it is easy to fix this failure. Tell your avionics shop to take the Sandel out and reseating it (the failure occures frequently after changing the bulb. Sandel recommends the tech hold the wiring harness in place while doing this.The only permanant solution to fix this problem is to have a service loop installed.- sometimes the Sandel could lose its settings (frequently coincident with low voltage battery issues). You can re-enter your settingsby yourself (at your own risk of course...) : you need to keep A and B keys pressed while powering up the unit to enter the maintenance mode first.",09:14:00,Tuesday

It will, however, set the proper inbound course on the HSI for a GPS or RNAV approach. The latter is called autoslew and is a GPS-based function only.""Wait a minute,"" you say. ""I've seen it set the course on an ILS before."" This is strictly by coincidence. Assume we are flying an ILS via vectors to final. If the CDI is in GPS mode and you activate vectors to final, the Garmin 430 autoslews the course to the inbound course on the HSI (the GPS in this case is for situational awareness only). Of course, you can't fly the ILS with the CDI set to GPS...it must be set to VLOC. Switching to VLOC can be done manually or automatically if the Garmin has the Auto ILS option set in the AUX pages. Subsequently, you press the CDI button (or it switches automatically) to VLOC to change the HSI to show the localizer (or VOR) signal. Since the Garmin has already set the inbound course into the HSI, the HSI keeps the same inbound course. So it appears that the proper course was set for you automatically when it was purely by coincidence.There are two problems with this. First, this will be incorrect for backcourse approaches that require the front course be set and not the inbound course. Garmin only knows about inbound courses. Second, if you happen to activate vectors to final when you have the CDI set to VLOC then it won't cause the course to autoslew and the HSI course will be whatever it is at the time you activated the approach. That'll force you to set the course manually.The moral of the story is to always set the course manually or verify that it is set properly. Most importantly, for localizer-based approaches, the front course must be set on the HSI (not the inbound course).",09:06:00,Tuesday

The display range can be chosen between 2 and 12 nm ; 30 intruder aircrafts could be tracked at the same time.The SkyWatch issues visual and aural (""traffic traffic"") Traffic Advisory when an intruder aircraft is detected within .55 nm distance and a +/- 800 ft relative altitude or a collision within next 30 seconds.A recent release of Skywatch software addes the feature of Verbal Intruder Positioning : you get callouts giving a ""clock"" heading and a low, same altitude or high, annunciation. It helps to spot traffic quickly keeping head up.Cirrus Design issued a Service Bulletin (SB2X-34-18)to inhibit aural warnings when flaps are set to 50% and 100%.The system consists of:a transmitter reciever computer,a directional antenna located on the roofinputs from the altitude encoder, heading system and a speed switch (Skywatch has a airswitch that is installed on the pitot line so aural warnings are suppressed on the ground). More recent aircraft (or those who have installed an optional Service Bulletin) inhibit the audio portion of traffic alerts when the flaps are deployed to reduce nusiance alerts in the traffic pattern.Skywatch can be set to above, below, normal, unrestricted or off.The way to use it is :  - above (show targets up to 9,000ft above and 2,700ft below your aircraft) for take off - normal (show targets 2,700ft above and below your aircraft) enroute - below (show targets 9,000ft below and 2,700ft above your aircraft) in descent- unrestricted (displays targets 9,900ft above AND below your position) ; M.R. (aka the Prez) routinely changes the display to unrestricted in flight - mostly because it's interesting to watch the other traffic...The SkyWatch does not replace visually outside visual scanbut helps a lot especially in crowded area near main VFR airports.The rule is to visualy identify intruder before maneuvering and never make a traffic assessment based on the traffic display information.Indeed the traffic display can be misinterpreted since it is based upon a moving reference.You should never consider your traffic display as a controller's radar display.TAS gives a partial traffic pictureTAS only detects intruders with an active transponderEven detected, aircrafts may not be depicted by TAS : limitation due to number of targets dispalyed or altitude filtering.Bearing measurement is not very accurate with bearings errors from 5?? to 30??). Due to this error the target symbol on the display can jump.The reference for the traffic display is the aircraft own positionThis give a display where targets are shown in relative motion which is a major cause of misinterpretation.an example is 2 aircrafts converging at 90??The following figures that the symbol of on aircraft on 90?? crossing track actually appears to be converging at a 45?? angle on the TAS display :another exampleof a situation where you could decide to make a right turn to avoid the traffic at same altitude, only refering upon the TAS display information. :This turn to the right could create a loss of separation.The good decision is to visual identify the intruder which should make you pass behind him.",09:05:00,Tuesday

TAWS uses digital elavation data, GPS position, and airplane instrumental values to predict if a likely future position of the aircraft intersects with the ground. rTAWS is also referred to as Enhanced Ground Proximity Warning System (EGPWS), and is required equipment for transport aircraft, and has prevented many accidents.rThe effectiveness of TAWS in the battle against CFIT has been nothing short of phenomenal. Bill Reavis, a spokesmen for Honeywell, puts it bluntly: ""No EGPWS (TAWS) equipped aircraft has had a CFIT accident, period"".Full TAWS provides both a visual map of nearby threatening terrain, and an audible warning. TAWS can be panel mounted, or provided by the Garmin 396/496 handhelds.There have been a number of tragic Cirrus CFIT accidents which might have been prevented with terrain warning allowing diversion or CAPs activation. Roughly half of the Cirrus accidents might have been avoidable if TAWS were installed. Color-coded maps as in the Garmin 430/530 terrain product do not provide the same protection as audible alerts.TAWS in and of itself is far more crucial to avoiding CFIT than simply ""having an instrument rating"". The typical VFR COPA Pilot would have little trouble controlling the aircraft in IMC using the autopilot. The old attitude that a VFR pilot will immediately lose control in the clouds is based on hand flying ability. The reality that a VFR pilot can control the aircraft quite adequately in practice using the autopilot probably tempts some of them into illegal IMC, where CFIT now becomes a real possibility.The portable Garmin 396 and 496 is considered a pretty good substitute for TAWS but ONLY if it is connected to the audio in a ""always on"" interface. Plugging it into the entertainment jack, where any radio traffic will take priority, is not the same.  One simple, low-tech solution to audio from the portable TAWS device is to use earbud-style headphones under your headset.  That ensures there will be no interruptions in vital TAWS alerts.rMember CommentsTAWS warns of terrain ahead and directs the pilot to ""pull up, pull up"". But can't that be the worst possible choice in some circumstances?rIt could be the worst choice, but at that point, it may be too late to do anything. But the majority of the time, it's absolutely the best possible choice. I teach a module on ODP's and CFIT during recurrent training with AirShares Elite pilots, and we look at four CFIT accidents which could have been prevented by following an ODP (Obstacle Departure Procedure). In three of the four accidents, impact with terrain occurred within 200' of the peak/ ridge line. In fact, this is the MO of nearly all CFIT accidents- within 200' of being a near miss. The TAWS will give you a minimum of 45 seconds warning- if you can climb at 300 FPM, you can avoid the majority of CFIT accidents.rTAWS does not take aircraft performance into account. It simply will give you 30 or 45-60 seconds warning (for a warning or caution, respectively) before projected impact with terrain or obstacles.The display will not ever tell you if a climb will ensure terrain clearance. It simply tells you the relative height of terrain to your current, GPS derived altitude. Thus, terrain 1000' above you will be depicted the same if it is 1 mile or 100 mile in front of you.The primary value of the unit is NOT the display, although as others have commented, it certainly does have strategic value that becomes more apparent with further use. Rather, the value is in the audible warning that requires no attention on your part to receive. This is the primary, and enormous value, of the TAWS over the 430 terrain system. If you're not looking at the 430 when the warning goes off, it may as well not be there. And on a low approach, you shouldn't be looking at anything but the PFD.A 180 is usually not a recommended avoidance procedure, unless you are certain which way to turn. And if you have the Situational Awareness to know which way to turn, you most likely would not have gotten within 45 seconds of terrain impact, to begin with.Yesterday I was giving a checkride and, during a GPS approach, we got a Terrain Warning on the 430. The eTaws did not indicate any terrain. At that point, 2 professional pilots that were very situationally aware, became confused. We were VFR but it was a little hazy. We knew the area and yet, it alarmed us. There are so many false warnings with the Garmin system on the 430, I would not recommend that system at all. SLC is surrounded by mountains so you are often required to fly close to high terrain when on a VFR transition route in and out of class B. On some routes both 430's give off a terrain warning every minute or so, making the warnings useless as you soon filter them out. The eTAWS is much more selective about its alerts. I believe that big difference is eTAWS constantly calculates a cone (or maybe a pyramid?) of possible places you could be in the next 60 seconds. Using airspeed and heading and altitude trends to figure it out. With garmin, it just seems to us a simple ""box"" (or maybe a pie slice?) of potential impacts that doesn't seem to change based on your current flight attitude. Some warnings with the garmin don't make sense. For example, you will have a tower 500 feet below you and 1/2 mile out and you are flying straight and level at 140 kts, you would have to make a drastic change in your flight path to hit such an obstacle, yet it still fires off a warning.As part of my pre-taxi check I disable terrain on GPS 1. One time right after we failed and then restarted the PFD, we got a ""PULL UP! PULL UP!"" warning. We were at about 4,000' over generally flat Minnesota terrain.Still, the initial response was ""That can't be right!"".I can see how one would really have to be trained and primed to actually have pulling up as a first reaction.BTW, it's hard for me to imagine a situation where pulling up could actually do harm - there's rarely terrain to collide with above you! he way around false alerts on the Garmin 430 is to switch to the terrain screen on the Garmin 430. No more alerts! Just glance at the screen for any red or yellow in your flight path. This is the way to use this tool.",20:24:00,Friday

This has been tied to shadowing due the location of the transponder antenna (between the exhaust pipes) and to the lack of an adequate ground plane for the antenna. Only rarely is there actually a problem with the transponder. There is generally no need to recycle the transponder in this event. In most cases a slight turn or just waiting a few moments will resolve the issue.For older aircraft, Cirrus has issued an optional Service Bulletin SB 2X-34-05 R1 (Aug. 2003) that installs a large metal washer at the base of the antenna. Owners report good results. Others have reported improvement with metal foil placed under the floor mats.",20:24:00,Friday

Many COPA members have begun using Apple Mac computers running Windows XP or Vista to keep their database subscriptions updated.  This can be done two ways:1. Under Boot Camp (Installation guide).  With this approach the computer is rebooted into Windows, and when finished with Windows programs, is rebooted to again run the Mac OS.2. Using Parallels (Product Information}  Using Parallels allows Windows to run virtually at the same time you are running Mac OS; you can use Mac or Windows programs simultaneously without rebooting.3. Consider using Fusion rather than Parallels. I have had trouble with Parallels after updates--some updates have not worked. I have not used Fusion, but reports have been that it runs better than Parallels on a iMAC.Both of these approaches require a recent Mac with an Intel processor. Boot Camp is included with Mac OS X 10.5 (Leopard).  Parallels is a separate product that must be purchased.  In either case, you need to purchase a full retail copy of Windows (XP service pack 2 or Vista).

Avionics operations,3,WAAS antenna installations options,https://www.cirruspilots.org/copa/member/sr_aircraft/w/copapedia/307.waas-antenna-installations-options.aspx,No, Roger Whittier,2014-05-13,0,"There are 3 methods of compliance to make these modifications.Cirrus SBGarmin's STCFAA Field approval form 337Cirrus just issued a revised SB for both PFD an non-PFD aircraft (1-29-2008). The only substantial change is that they make it clear that you may update only the GPS1 Garmin radio/antenna or do both GPS1 and GPS2. The down side to doing only 1 radio is that you loose cross fill, have to manage GPS subscriptions differently and you can only use GPS1 for WAAS approaches. From a shops point of view completing a SB is the best way to comply with FAA and manufactures rules.Garmin issued the first STC for their new 430W radio allowing it to be put in a number of approved aircraft for which Cirrus is listed. The STC does NOT tell the mechanic exactly how to install the radio or antennas rather it gives him/her guidelines for the installation. Some instructions are absolute and refer to FAA rules, for example the need to have annunciators in the pilots view. The early Versions of the STC did not include connections to the Avidyne PFD so only the owners with 6 -pac's were eligible for STC approved installations. In October 2007 The STC was revised with the release of Garmin's Ver 3.0 software. The software fixed a number of bugs. More importantly the STC now provided connection to the Avidyne PFD. In November Garmin released software bulletin 07040 Rev A to upgrade the software to ver 3.0 and Cirrus followed releasing SA07-23 on December 13, 2007 for the software upgrade. Noted in the new releases were the ability to remove operational limitations of certain antennas. This antenna thing is important as I continue.Again, not happy with the time and money required I was seeking alternatives. I found a product to split one antenna for two radios and mathematically proved the losses for the splitter were acceptable. The product does NOT have any FAA, approvals although used in military aircraft. My local FAA inspector would not approve the use of the splitter so this idea is out. Other ideas included putting the 2nd antenna in the wing tip or in the engine compartment. The STC does not prohibit placement under the skin of the aircraft. Heat is an issue under the cowling as the antenna is rated to 185dg F. The wing tip has issues too, as the strobe may interfere and the STC calls for placement on ""top of the aircraft"".The Garmin STC does not provide approvals for structural mounting. They leave that issue to the shop and the particular airplane. Our composite body is highly regulated by Cirrus's manuals. You can not just mount an antenna on the skin, drilling holes anywhere you want. My efforts were directed to using an approved location or location where Cirrus demonstrates that holes were drilled for a antenna in the present or past.I see only a few ways to install the GPS2 antenna at this point. Garmin's STC still lets you put the antenna anywhere it will work following their guidelines as long as the location does not violate the manufactures rules. You could put it in the back window for example. Placement is a matter of functionality and looks. For example the back window would work but you might not like the way it looks.For GPS1Garmin will send you a GA35 antenna for each radio with your upgrade that is a tear drop style. Installing this antenna in the GPS1 spot where the Cirrus SB shows will also fail to comply because the holes will not match the SB designed antenna (ARINC743). But you can request Garmin to send you GA36 (WAAS only) which is the same rectangular style (ARINC743) that Cirrus is using. I can't say if there is or is not extra cost. If you want the combination, WAAS/XM antenna (GA37) then it will cost something. Your Garmin dealer will have to figure this one out. If you don't get the WAAS/XM and you have a XM up front it could be remounted under the glare shield. If you use the Garmin antennas, then you should complete the job under the Garmin's STC. Note you still need to have the shop do all the grounding work like the SB shows to cover lightning issues. This way the shop can show compliance with practices and procedures the manufacture uses. Essentially your not buying Cirrus's expensive kit substituting parts from other approved sources. OR Do the Cirrus SB for GPS1 and buy the Cirrus kit. WAAS only kit is $1,239 or WAAS/XM is $1,877. The labor cost should be the same for both GPS1 choicesFor GPS2You really don't have much of a choice if you want the antenna on the outside of the plane. Since drilling holes anywhere (as stated above) is not approved unless you get Cirrus's blessing you must complete the Cirrus SB to have the antenna mounted on the skin of the plane.OR The Garmin STC list a Comant CL-2580-200 combination VHF+GPS/WAAS (no XM) antenna (list price $1120). This combo antenna can replace the current Com1 antenna. At one point Cirrus demonstrates the necessary holes per SB 2X-34-06 R2 page 17 of 21. Comant has another antenna in development (not available yet) CI-2728-410 which will do all XM too. If you have XM then you need an XM antenna somewhere. Options are to buy a XM/WAAS approved antenna for the GPS1 spot. Cirrus sells this in their kit, antenna alone is $990 and the kit is $1,877. One caveat is that if you use the Cirrus kit you should complete the Cirrus SB for GPS1 for compliance. On some planes the Fin type Comant antenna provided as an original antenna caused vibrations in the clouds and can cause cracking at the mount. Using the proposed Comant CL-2580-200 is the same fin style as the type that caused vibrations. There is no guarantee that you will not have a vibration issue. Comant stands by their antenna as not causing vibration. They blame the mounting conditions and the aircraft. I want to say it is up to the installer to make sure the antenna is secure, tight and that if needed a backing plate be added. The difference between one plane and another could be as simple as loose bolts or the mounting holes aligned differently.OR Find an inside spot to mount the Garmin provided antenna. The Garmin STC provides approval for this following their procedures. They even say the glareshield is a choice but Cirrus (in a Service Advisory) recommends against the glareshield location. Your shop will have to decide if they want to sign off on this location. You and your shop have one more option if you still want to use the glareshield location. Complete the Garmin STC and do not certify the GPS2 unit for GPS Precision Approaches. This would be no different than mounting a 496 in the console for VFR use only.WAAS antenna under the glareshieldThe Garmin STC shows an option of putting the antenna under the glareshield. Cirrus put out a Service advisory saying don't put it under the glareshield. I think the SA was politically motivated or a legal CYA, but you have to choose to go against the manufactures service advisory or not. The owners that installed the antenna under the glareshield have good results. As you move to the North the angle to the satellite is shallower. If you install the antenna under the glareshield may sure it is as high and forward as possible.Why the glare shield antenna can fail.Two WAAS satellites are stationed over the equator. To see them from a northern place such as Duluth the satellite is at a 32 dg elevation above the horizon. If you look at the angle from just below the glare shield to the top edge of the windshield it is about 25 dg. Now point the plane down 3 degrees for a North bound approach add 2 more for pitch error and you can see you have only 2 more degrees before you get blocked by the top of the plane which has metal in it. In the Southern US the angle is 46 degrees, not a factor anymore.ELT shield A ELT shield is to be installed with the Cirrus SB. I can't say exactly what the issues but the ELT has a habit is going off by itself. Radio energy is the culprit so shield it help. If you do the Cirrus SB you have to shield it. The part cost $81 from Cirrus and time is maybe 30 minutes. If do the Garmin STC it is not required but there is a interference check that must be performed.Approvals.Any IA can do the Cirrus SB. The Garmin STC can be completed by a IA with a 337 filed but if the shop is a Approved Repair Station then no further approvals are needed.Some additional info on pricing. 70190-001 #1 w/o xm 1239.0270109-002 #1 with xm 1877.4118389-001 ELT shield for 121.5 MHz 81.38If a person was going to install the antenna inside I would stay away from SB sign-off. It states must be external...I will have to review the Garmin stc again. (Just food for thought)CAUTION: Under certain headings and geographic locations, using the existing GPS antenna locations could result in loss-of or weakened WAAS reception. On Cirrus aircraft, the Garmin 400WSeries Navigator suggests an external antenna installation.",08:57:00,Tuesday
Avionics operations,3,Waypoint sequencing mode,https://www.cirruspilots.org/copa/member/sr_aircraft/w/copapedia/waypoint-sequencing-mode.aspx,No, Eharrison,2013-08-16,0,"When you press ""OBS"" on the Garmin 430 you take it out of Waypoint Sequencing mode (indicated by the fact that OBS is illuminated above the button). When Waypoint Sequencing is off, there is no flight plan info sent from the 430 to the MFD so no courseline is indicated. The fix is to reenable waypoint sequencing by pressing OBS again, extinguishing the OBS light (but confusingly not leaving OBS mode). That will reenable waypoint sequencing, and your OBS course line will be painted on the MFD.On the Garmin G1000 they actually have split the OBS button into two; one for OBS and the other for Waypoint Sequencing Mode.  This makes it much less confusing.Using OBS Mode to Create an Extended CenterlineWhen flying to an airport with no instrument approaches, it is often desirable to create an extended runway centerline on the MFD, in order to aid the pilot with runway alignment.  The following technique will create a magenta line extending from the center of the airport along a path leading to the runway selected.1.  Select direct to your landing airport on the Garmin 4302.  Press the OBS button.3.  Make sure the top left PFD button source is GPS 14.  Select the top left PFD button.5.  Rotate the left PFD knob to the landing runway heading (ie. 230 for runway 23, if you know the actual runway heading; even better)6.  Press the OBS button.7.

CAPS,3,CAPS limitations,https://www.cirruspilots.org/copa/member/sr_aircraft/w/copapedia/caps-limitations.aspx,No, Eharrison,2013-08-16,0,"I began my professional career as a physician. With the help of the United States Air Force I ultimately became a board certified specialist in Aerospace Medicine. During my time in the Air Force I had the opportunity to become very familiar with the various parachute based crew recovery systems.  I had the opportunity to fly in the T33, T37, T38, and F104, all of which utilized a parachute based crew ejection seat. Each seat was different in those aircraft with the most complex ejection seat found in the F104 which actually used a ballistic charge in the parachute back worn by the crew to facilitate parachute deployment after ejection seat deployment.  My most interesting experience was flying the FB-111.  The FB-111 utilized a crew capsule recover system, which shares many similarities with the Cirrus CAP?€?s system. Since I flew as a crew member in the FB-111 (right seat), I had to be familiar with the system and how to use it. I gained most of my knowledge of the F-111 crew capsule system by participating in the accident investigation boards of several F-111 accidents. I even had the opportunity to participate in the recovery of the crews in two (one successful and one unsuccessful) crew capsule deployments. In each case I got the opportunity to study the crew capsules after ejection. For those who want to know more about the F111 crew capsule and ejection seats, here and here are two interesting resources.When the pilot initiates ejection in the F-111 the entire cockpit of the aircraft separates and is ultimately lowered to the ground by a parachute.  Because the operating envelope of the F111 is so big (supersonic speeds and altitudes over FL500) the ?€?CAPs?€? system on the F111 was very complex.  But whether it is an ejection seat, a crew capsule like the F111 or Apollo capsule, there is a standard protocol about when to deploy the parachute.  In these advanced systems a computer decides when the parachute is deployed, not the pilot. The pilot simply pulls the ejection handle then takes a ride, leaving the details of parachute deployment to the computers.All of these systems determine the time to deploy the parachute based on what airspeed and altitude mode the aircraft is in: Mode 1, Mode 2 and Mode 3. See chart below:None of the ejection systems allow parachute deployment in Mode 3. When (and if) the escape system (ejection seat or crew capsule) reaches Mode 2 parameters a drogue chute is deployed for stabilization and slowing, then when Mode 1 parameters are reached full parachute deployment takes place. The most significant reason to avoid full parachute opening in Mode 2 or Mode 3 are problems related to opening shock of the parachute.  I leave it to the reader to learn more about high altitude/speed opening shock, but the bottom line is that a parachute opening at high altitude and/or airspeed can exert very high ?€?G?€? loads on the system.All of this is background as we consider the operating envelope of the Cirrus TN22 and ultimately ?€?the-jet?€?.  As you can see in the table above, the current SR22 CAP?€?s system limitations fit very close to the Mode 1 box allowing full and immediate parachute deployment below 17,500 MSL and 133 knots.  Actually the current SR22 is operating in Mode 3 between 15,000 and 17,500 MSL.The problems begin as we consider the use of CAP?€?s up to FL250.  Both the TN22 and ?€?the-jet?€? are going to operate at these altitudes.  ?€?the-jet?€? will always be cruising in Mode 3.  So will these aircraft carry operating limitations not to deploy CAPs above FL180? What about high altitude upset? For the TN22 if it departs controlled flight in the flight levels, it would likely build up speed exceeding the CAP?€?s red line of 133 and might stay in the Mode 2 envelop below 10,000. Based on my reading, opening shock is less for any given airspeed as you get lower, thus the slope of the Mode1/Mode2 envelop between 15,000 and sea level. This may explain why Ilan?€?s low altitude CAPs deployment was successful at 190kts. Deploying CAPs at 17,000 and 190kts might yield a different result.Many questions to be answered but based on what I have been able to read a full CAP?€?s deployment above 15,000 feet should be avoided. No Air Force, Navy or NASA crew escape system will allow full parachute deployment above 15,000, so there must be a very good reason for this limitation.",20:47:00,Friday

CAPS,3,Cirrus Parachute System (CAPS) activation decision,https://www.cirruspilots.org/copa/member/sr_aircraft/w/copapedia/cirrus-parachute-system-caps-activation-decision.aspx,No, Eharrison,2013-08-16,0,"ContentsrSimulator ExperienceResults of interviewsDecide before you are on a runwayMental TrainingFollow ProcedurePull at any AltitudeSimulator ExperienceAt some point in the flight, at about 4,000?€?, the plane entered what seemed to be a spin. I pushed the stick forward, determined the direction of rotation and pushed opposite rudder. I think I retarded the throttle as well. I seemed to be making some progress (I thought) when someone in the peanut gallery said ?€?chute??€?. Seemed like a plan and I reached up for the handle, but it was blocked by the cover. I spent a second or two fumbling with the tiny pull-tab on the cover, and then hit the ground. Yikes.Turns out the left wing had departed and the ?€?spin?€? was unrecoverable.This was a real eye-opener to me. I had wondered why the NY pilots who spun never pulled the chute and was certain I would have. Now I?€?m not so sure.Observations:1) Once the plane started to ?€?spin?€? the only term I can think of is ?€?task fixation?€?. r   I was 100% wrapped up in recovering from the spin. I?€?ve done hundreds of spins in r   the past and managed to recover from each and every one, so why not this one?r   Warren Zevon (R.I.P.) sang ?€?You?€?re a whole ?€?nother person when you?€?re scared?€?. r   Even in a simulation this was pretty intense and the amount of fixation was remarkable. r   Kind of like tunnel vision with blinders to any other task.rr2) IMHO, having the CAPS cover in place could have fatal consequences. In this case, r   I don?€?t care what the POH says (and that means something coming from me!). If the r   cover is a required placard, maybe it could be Velcro?€?d to the ceiling next to the r   handle (I think Mike has the ?€?Pull Procedure?€? laminated in the handle?€?s recess). r   Turns out in my scenario I also had the pin in place - again, I blame this on not r   having my own checklist which I?€?m very used to. Still, it shows poor use of the r   checklist which was provided.rr3) I thought Mike R?€?s ?€?BAM-touch head-grab handle?€? exercise was cute but a bit r   over-the-top. I take it back, and will practice it myself in the future.rSimilarly, I was impressed when Jeff Seymore briefed the takeoff by showing, on the backup altimeter, the altitude where he would start considering the ?€?chute and no longer commit to a straight ahead landing if the engine failed. Again, a good idea which I may incorporate into my own routine.Results of interviewsFortunately we have COPA Pilots to ask about this. I've listen to a couple of interviews and talked with another couple of pilots who activated the parachute and read a couple of interviews for a total of 8 of the 9 CAPS saves. Common thing: all of them explain about deciding quickly to pull the handle!rNow, this is not in terms of reaction times, but more likely in terms of a sequence of thoughts and confirmations and actions.As for how to train for this, my suggestion is two-fold: 1) On the ground, make a plan for how you would recognize that you have r   lost controlr2) In the air, practice so it becomes muscle memory the actions necessary r   to activate the CAPS handlerNote, that in 1) I'm not suggesting that you simply consider under what circumstances you would pull the handle, but how you would know you are no longer in control! In all of those stories from COPA Pilots who have activated the parachute system, they all talk about giving up control. Aviate, navigate, communicate won't get you to pulling the parachute. They did something else -- recognizes that further effort was not going rto make their situation better.rOf course, this prompts lots of second guessing, name calling, judgments, etc. But of those pilots with whom I talked, they care less. They made a decision that they are pleased to live with!Decide before you are on a runwayI have a habit of noting the ""CAPs active"" altitude before take off. When I reach that altitude, I think or mumble to myself, ""CAPs active."" At that point, CAPs has become an option.Obviously, immediately after the ""CAPs active"" point, I also know there can be little or no hesitation about pulling it if something goes terribly wrong. The higher I get, the more time I have to analyze before the pull decision. But you are correct, you must think about your options, and how much time you have to exercise the CAPs option, and mentally practice. For me, I think that at 1000 feet AGL, there is little time to ponder the choice. At 5000 feet AGL, I have a brief amount of time to try to figure things out. Mental TrainingThe time for deciding what your benchmark for a CAPs pull is not in the middle of an emergency. You should imagine those situations ahead of time, mentally rehearse them, and be ready to execute if one of the situations arises. Otherwise, you may have wasted a lot of money on a nice rocket you will not even get to see fire off in your post crash fire.Follow ProcedureAfter removing the Chute Pin cover during run-up, remove the pin itself. Reasons for removing the pin before leaving the ground, especially when there is a right-seat passenger, include pilot-incapacitation during the climb out. It can be left in for service.This helps to crystallize my options during this critical phase of flight. Much like calculating a committed airspeed in large planes that use most of the runway for takeoff.VFR depending on terrain the chute remains my ONLY option until reaching the altitude that I calculated during preflight gives me a reasonable forced landing area.IFR in IMC it remains my ONLY option up to 5,000 AGL minimum. And descending through 2000' AGL if I have not solved the problem and still IMC the chute becomes my primary option again.Pull at any AltitudeI'm now convinced that activating CAPS at any altitude is better than not. The Indianapolis CAPS save appears to have been a late activation at a low altitude into a shallow pond (witness describes the parachute still in a reefed configuration). The damage to the plane is more than any we had seen before. Did the effect of the activation provide some deceleration that made an impact into a 4-foot deep pond survivable?",20:48:00,Friday

There's a tower there, but it's more like uncontrolled fields in the US with a Flight Service Station that acts as an airport advisory service (Altoona, PA comes to mind). We stopped in Fort Pierce on the way and they were very helpful with raft rentals and customs paperwork/procedures. Another big advantage of Ft. Pierce is that customs, FBO and the restaurant are all right next to each other.It's a big resort with extremely deluxe and comfortable rooms. They have a beautiful beach and nice pools and grounds. It is quiet, so I wouldn't recommend more than a few days there, and expect the usual four seasons pricing for everything -- e.g. $20 hamburgers :-) If you're a diver, there is some good scuba at Exuma. The dive operation is in the south (near Peace and Plenty), but they can pick you up.Easy trip (we did it in C210) from Fort Pierce to Freeport Direct- Direct takes you just over Nassua and then you pick up the north end of the Exuma chain pretty quickly...maybe another 40 minuts for about a 2 hour flight total. Big runway in great condition - 15 to 20 mins from the hotel.Treasure Cay, AbacosI have been to TC as much as anywhere, so due to familiarity, it is one of my favorites. Of course, a friend keeps his sport fishing boat there as well, which increases its appeal to me.I am a big fan of all the Abacos. I think there is a wide variety all within a reasonable distance. A lot of options if you include water taxis. I've even been in the Abaconian, the local paper twice!There is nothing wrong with TC, but I couldn't list every destination! Marsh Harbour and TC are failry similar. For a first timer, Marsh Harbour has a little more to offer. It's a bigger town. TC has a better beach, an excellent beach bar (both located across the street from the hotel). TC also has a golf course and similarly good access to the water taxis to the other cays.The negatives are no Avgas, 20 minute cab ride from airport. Limited # of restaurants. The rooms at the hotel are OK. Less choices overal.Green Turtle Cay is a short ferry boat ride from the Treasure Cay Airport and has real out island charm, see their web sites. The Green Turtle Club has the BEST pina Coladas.we normally stay at one of the Royal Palms units. Rhonda with Island Dreams could take care of you. Her email is [emailprotected] I will be there myself from June 9th-15th with my family. Let me know when your going, and maybe we can have a Goombay together at the Tipsy.Notes""",08:35:00,Tuesday
Destinations,3,"Flying to Ensenada, Mexico",https://www.cirruspilots.org/copa/member/sr_aircraft/w/copapedia/flying-to-ensenada-mexico.aspx,No, Eharrison,2013-08-16,0,"I flew IFR to Ensenada, Mexico (MMES) for a wedding last weekend. Here's a brief summary of my experience:For preparation, Baja Bush Pilots was invaluable. Not only do they have an inexpensive Mexico insurance policy but they provide lots of valuable information on what to expect. Most of their published experience is VFR. I bought a Trip Kit from Jeppesen including enroute and approach plates.I filed IFR from Camarillo, CA to Ensenada. I was given the TEC procedure as far as Brown Field in San Diego and then Tijuana (TIJ) and then direct Ensenada.The weather was VFR as far as San Diego but deteriorated quickly once I crossed the border with a solid overcast layer over the coast.Luckily, I had practiced the NDB approach with the Garmin trainer. Tijuana approach reported the weather at Ensenda as 1500 overcast, well above the 900ft approach minimums.Tijuana approach cleared me for the NDB approach and handed me off to the tower at Ensenada. The tower controller was almost impossible to understand. He had poor English skills compounded by a horrible transmitter and Mexican music bleeding through on his frequency. Its not just your AM radio that will pick up Mexican music!I was instructed by the tower to maintain 5,000 ft until crossing the NDB consistent with the approach chart.Once established outbound I descended into the overcast at 3500 ft and was in solid IMC for the procedure turn at 2500 ft. I contacted the tower again after the inbound turn and was given clearance to land on Rwy 29 (Circle to Land).At 1200 ft I was still in the soup, preparing for a missed approach and a return to Tijuana. I finally broke out at 1000 ft right over the Ensenada cruise ship terminal with the runway straight ahead. Whew!Mexico customs was uneventful. They asked for license, insurance, airworthiness, and registration. They did NOT ask for a radio license although I had one onboard. I was directed to the ramp for parking. Bring your own tiedowns and walk the ramp before choosing a spot. Much of the pavement is broken with loose gravel and many tiedowns are broken or missing.When we departed on Sunday, the weather was solid IMC all the way to San Diego. I called San Diego FSS (bring the full phone number with you, not the ""866"" number!) and filed IFR to Brown Field to clear customs. I had the ADCUS message in the remarks field but called customs directly to ensure they had my arrival time. Again, bring the full phone numbers with you.You also must file an IFR flight plan in Mexico. This is done by seeing the airport commander and filling out a flight plan form which is similar to the US version. By the time I loaded my luggage and passengers, the tower had my clearance available.A note on departing IFR .. there is NO ODP published and there is some minor terrain surrounding the Ensenda area. Ceilings were 2500 overcast. I studied the chart and basically climbed on the runway heading over the ocean to 3500 ft (1500 ft higher than the highest terrain in the area) before turning to join V1 to Tijuana at 8000ft. According to Tijuana approach this was the correct procedure although it was not part of my clearance. I called San Diego Radio and updated my arrival time for customs as it was apparent I was going to be given wide vectors for the approach into Brown.A few observations:The Mexican officials were initially a bit grumpy but if you smile alot and bring along a pretty blonde girlfriend they warm up in a hurry. I tipped the immigration guy $10 and made is whole day.Ensenda airport is also a Mexico military base so I was comfortable leaving my airplane to be guarded by teenagers with automatic weapons. Make copies of all of the documents. After they see the originals they will accept copies from you and you save alot of time while they warm up the circa 1974 Xerox.US Customs at Brown Field was uneventful but I was held on the ground for 35mins for departure clearance. Solid IMC in SoCal had things backed up in the area.Credits:Stuart Smith N223SS SR22GTS 1819 KCMA",20:52:00,Friday
Destinations,3,Grand Canyon,https://www.cirruspilots.org/copa/member/sr_aircraft/w/copapedia/335.grand-canyon.aspx,No, Roger Whittier,2014-05-13,0,"Reference an article on flying the Grand Canyon in the July 2006 issue (pdf) of COPA Pilot magazine, pages 24 and 25.KGCN - Grand Canyon National Park Airportthe Grand Canyon's airspace has been partitioned into ""sectors"". And, there are defined ""corridors"" (with specific altitudes) for traversing some of the sectors. Corridor entry/exits are identified via lat/long coordinates that you can plug into your GPS. Take a look at the Grand Canyon VFR Aeronautical Chart for details.By the way, you share the corridors with many sightseeing aircraft. And, there are three different monitor frequencies; which one you use depends upon location.My wife and I flew into KGCN last October. The FBO was very nice and gave us a ride both ways into down. Fuel was readily available. We stayed over one night and took the grand canyon at sunset jeep tour. It was awesome. Wear something warm. At takeoff, I leaned to the placarded fuel flow, but there was enough power to take off and land two or three times on the runway. I used flight following to overfly the canyon, and it was a great experience. No surprises, no hiccups. Enjoy!I flew into GCN last summer in our 22. Check Density Altitude. Also remember to lean the aircraft on arrival and departure since it's a very high altitude airport. If memory serves me correctly there's a terminal building with a small trailer (scenic air) that you can get fuel from. Beyond that, it's a good mile walk to the nearest resteraunt. I wasn't too impressed with the facilities, the airport caters mainly to the commercial grand canyon tours.With regard to sightseeing at the Grand Canyon, you'll wind up landing at GCN and taking some form of transportation to the motels located just outside the park, itself. Or, you could spring for bigger bucks and stay at one of the lodges in the park (e.g., El Tovar!?) All of the motels have tours, taxis, etc. to get you into the park. And, once you're in the park, you can hop on a tour bus that will take you along the rim. All of the sightseeing stuff can be lined up after you arrive.One other possibility would be to land at Williams, AZ (west of Flagstaff) and take the train up to the Canyon.",08:33:00,Tuesday

Please don't hesitate to call me or any of the other COPA members up at Mtn. Air since I am sure they will all be eager to offer help and advice on local conditions and the approach. COPA member and Mtn. Air owner Clark Jernigan (contact info above) has a comprehensive knowledge of Mtn. Air and mountain flying in general and has indicated his desire to be of service to those wishing a briefing on the flight. Please take advantage of the local knowledge offered. It is the kind of approach that demands respect.Mountain Air provides briefing materials to all pilots who wish to land at 2NC0. These materials are considered mandatory viewing prior to arrival. To those unfamiliar with mountain flying, it presents unique challenges that are certainly manageable, but must be taken into consideration particularly when landing in the mountains.Every time I fly into Mtn. Air I am amazed at the natural beauty of the location and how spectacular it is to land on top of a mountain. I hope everyone enjoys it as much as I do. Have a safe and memorable flight!I flew to MountainAir yesterday with my instructor (a very patient and talented man), Joe Davis, as I want to take my wife to the Fly In next Saturday, but had decided that a practice with an expert would be expedient. Seriously, the briefing information provided was very helpful, but the reality of the airstrip was even more ""extreme"" than I had imagined. I had to force myself to think that descending towards the mountain whilst on downwind was a ""good thing"" - despite years of believing that mountains were to be flown away from! Once I overcame that. and the other visual ""cues and clues"" that were different, and got my height and speed absolutely right, I made a ""normal"" landing, well before the 2000 foot mark, and came to a gradual and controlled stop.The staff in the pro shop / Unicom were delightful and very welcoming (I had telephoned previously to get prior permission to land).Overall a lovely place, great people, spectacular views, and character- building stick'n'rudder skill development.A lot of rising terrain. I practiced a lot of short field technique before flying into Mt Air, really helped.Once you get your mind around the idea of flying onto and into a mountain with non standard visual cues it becomes less challenging and actually amazingly enjoyable.",08:01:00,Tuesday
Destinations,3,Puerto Rico,https://www.cirruspilots.org/copa/member/sr_aircraft/w/copapedia/puerto-rico.aspx,No, Eharrison,2013-08-16,0,"""Following is a COPA Member post from Dec 2006flying to Puerto Rico is an easy trip. MIA (or your preferred airport) to ZQA (that?€?s Nassau VOR for those unfamiliar), turn right and follow A555 till you get to TJSJ (That?€?s San Juan, or your airport of choice.) Oh, by the way. Don?€?t forget to stop for gas at an Airport Of Entry (AOE) of your choice.I could have done the whole trip without a fuel stop, but I would have landed with 2 gallons and I?€?m not that brave or stupid (choose one). IT CAN BE DONE, SEE BELOW. In some sense, this did present, at least a consideration of a quandary. If you were to fly direct, you don?€?t have to clear customs. It has something to do with Puerto Rico being our 51st state. But anyhow, Puerto Rico uses U.S. Customs, so technically you are flying from the U.S. to the U.S., ergo, no customs,Back to reality. You have to make a gas stop, so pick one. Both gas stops require you to clear Bahamas Customs even though you are only stopping for gas. Truthfully, Bahamas customs is a bunch more user friendly than U.S. Customs. You can choose between a multitude of stops in the Bahamas. In my case, I preferred to stay close to my route, A-555. My choices were MYLS, Stella Maris, or Provo, Turks & Cacaos (often locally referred to as ?€?turds & chaos?€?) MYLS is a buck per gallon cheaper on gas, so that was my stop. I like Stella Maris. The 4000 ft runway was just paved and is well maintained with just a light dusting of sand. The Island itself is a beauty, not heavily traveled but very pilot friendly.The owners of the FBO, Al & Jane Wehrenberg acquired the business 11 years ago when they retired from their accounting practice in New Jersey, stopped chasing rats in the race, and pursued their passion; flying the islands. Ironically, they don?€?t fly that much anymore since they love calling Stella Maris home. The island has a rich history with 2 well established pilot friendly hotels, but that?€?s for another story.Clearing Bahamian Customs is a pleasure. I landed with no forms filled out and walked out of the Customs office 5 min later. Having flown 2 hours from Miami, I enjoyed my stretch and bathroom break, and off I went for my next 3.5 hr leg. You might as well go to sleep (I didn?€?t) because it?€?s a straight run. No turns, just point to point. Other than switching gas tanks there isn?€?t much to do, so bring a good book. The first 2/3?€?s of the flight are not too far* from land or other boats (* ?€?Not too far?€? is a term of art, construed differently by differing persons?€?). Conversely, the last 1/3 of the trip is over very open water. I had 4 life jackets at the ready, wearing one, over my survival vest. My hand was wrapped around my survival bag (which contained such things as my life raft, flares, mirrors, and other such stuff.) In my case, shark repellant is not necessary as I am extended professional courtesy in the event of a ditching. I also had my PLB Velcro?€?d to the dash with the antenna extended. If I had to ditch, the PLB would be triggered long before I hit the water.Please don?€?t tell your plane it is flying over water. It will get nervous; you might too. Fortunately, my SR22 never realized that it was over water so we had no problems.Upon arriving in Puerto Rico, I then had to clear U.S. Customs and parked at MillionAir, rAnd that was it. All in all, a wonderful trip with beautiful vistas and shades of blue water and puffy clouds. It?€?s not for everyone, but for me, it?€?s just something not to be missed.I flew to Puerto Rico non stop from FXE it was a seven hour sit to Fajardo but I landed with 18 gallons and a sore bum but didn't have to clear customs and was damn proud of it.  a 15 minute drive to my condo and voila cocktails and a sunset to boot.  Check the wx with the links on the copa web site check winds aloft and the RH at the two altitudes and pick a nice day with no or few clouds and you'll be fine.  If still concerned look up the flights that other copans have taken to europe over the atlantic to greenland.  There is great info about leaning planing for overwater flights.  Fuel in PR was surprisingly affordable.  trips to St croix and st thomas are no customs in but customs on return to pr.  The return to the states was easier as the 300 miles over open water is at the beginning so after passing the turks you can up the power to what ever you feel comfortable landing with the return trip was only five hours.  Several nice airports, san juan international is convinent to surprise unsuspecting friends landing on commercial flights the other in san juan, isla grande has customs and is much more manageable.  the smaller airports will do customs from the outer islands mentioned before but from the bahamas it has to be either of the san juan airports.  I visited fajardo the two san juan airports humacao ponce mayaguez and borinquen.  All are doable in a cirrus.  There are two islands that belong to PR and you do not have to go thru customs to either Vieques or Culebra.  Vieques is a piece of cake to land at and some wonderful places to stay and see the bioluminecent bay is not to be missed.  Culebra is a challenge to land at.  It took four patterns before I felt comfortable touching down.  Both Islands are good fun.  A stop in the bahamas is nice but is not necessary with the proper planning and flexibility to wait for good wx. Good Luck and have fun""",20:54:00,Friday
Experiences,3,Airsick kids,https://www.cirruspilots.org/copa/member/sr_aircraft/w/copapedia/267.airsick-kids.aspx,No, Roger Whittier,2014-05-13,0,"There is such a thing as tolerance training. Do a little bit of flying without him getting sick and land. Try again a week later for a bit longer of a flight, without him getting sick, land. Slow progression, one baby step at a time, can gradually increase his tolerance so that he has an excellent chance of making the whole flight. It will avoid him hating to fly and getting sick to avoid it.I recommend ""MotionEaze"" product. Smells like a mint, apply behind ears and go bore through the clouds.We used ""MotionEaze"" and it worked fairly well. Then I bought the Relief Bands (electrical stimulus in a little watch type style) and have had terrific luck with my now 6 year old. The bulletproof answer is ""MotionEaze"" and the relief bands--not a single event.Here are some passive relief bands.",07:33:00,Tuesday
Experiences,3,Approach briefing,https://www.cirruspilots.org/copa/member/sr_aircraft/w/copapedia/268.approach-briefing.aspx,No, Roger Whittier,2014-05-13,0,"""Flying IFR into GillespieI had a chance to fly to a new airport today -- Gillespie in San Diego (KSEE). I was IFR, but KSEE was VFR by the time I got there. Nonetheless I flew the LOC approach.I try to do a thorough briefing of any approach I make. One of the things I do is to check how fast I will have to descend on my step downs. If you looks at this plate you see that you have to descend from 2700' at GRIGG to 1540' at the MAP. I fly the approach at 120 kias (2 nm/min). Since the MAP is 2.4 miles from GRIGG, I would have 1:12 to descend 1160'. That's 967 fpm -- call it 1000.Okay, so I turn and intercept the LOC and do my stepdowns. The first thing I notice is that you fly between two HUGE peaks just after the IAF (BARET). Yeah, they are on the plate, but they sure seem closer on the approach. This is a serious approach -- you don't want to be low or sideways on this one!ATC handed me to the tower which told me to report GRIGG. Okay ... except ... no GRIGG in my Garmin. Oops! I saw GRIGG when briefing the approach but just assumed it would be in the Garmin. Now I have to figure out how to ID it. Had I realized that ahead of time I would have seen that GRIGG is the final marker -- it shows the FM symbol, it refers to GRIGG FM several times, etc., but I am coming up on it and not thinking so I try the Garmin NEAREST page thinking might be on there.Wrong.So I fudge it and call 2.4 from the MAP which is the equivalent. I should have noticed the blaring marker sound, but I was not being very observant.Tower cleared me to land and asked if I needed to circle or just land straight in. At that point I realized just how high I really am. Yes, I only needed 1000 fpm to descend from GRIGG to the MAP, but the MAP is 1153' above the runway, and only 1/3rd of a mile away from the runway. To land from GRIGG you need to descend 2313' in 1:21, or 1,713 fpm.It was VMC and I had no troubles, but I realized that my brief was woefully inadequate and had it been IMC I would have been behind. Lessons learned:1. Make sure you calculate the descent rate required for ALL parts of the approach.2. When you load the approach, check to see if ALL the waypoints are in the Garmin.    If not, make sure you know how you will identify those that are not.Oh well, you learn something every day. On the bright side, KSEE is a very cool airport.""",07:31:00,Tuesday
Experiences,3,Flying to LAX,https://www.cirruspilots.org/copa/member/sr_aircraft/w/copapedia/269.flying-to-lax.aspx,No, Roger Whittier,2014-05-13,0,"First LAX tripThe COPA resources were Neil's excellent trip report, a conversation with Gordon to build backbone, and some tidbits from Jeff Moss during the last CPPP about using the stepdowns on the ILS and not the glideslope until the FAF's.The in-airplane resources were CMAX (I used no paper charts except en-routes) and my right-seater. My friend was a lapsed private-pilot, but was huge help, especially in the most challenging part. That of course is the taxiing, and my friend is the founder of a high-performance driving school. Who better to have next to you on the ground at LAX than a driving instructor!The key to the trip of course is the homework. During the flight down, we briefed the two most likely STARs, the 4 possible ILS's, several of the Standard Taxi Routes, and the Airport Diagram in detail. Everytime I was handed to a new controller on the way down I tried to get advance information about what was going to happen in the routing.ZOA could not tell me which STAR I was going to get, but ZLA did (VTU.SADDE6), and no-one but my final controller would commit to the runway.As Neil notes, the FBO is at A5 off runway 25L on the south side, but 25L is the main heavy iron runway.The ATIS announced visual approaches to all westbound runways. I requested 25L with each controller, but they demurred, sending me to SMO at 2000', outbound on hdg070 -- essentially a downwind leg for any runway. Shortly after crossing SMO they cleared me for immediate visual to 24R -- essentially a power-off descending base-leg into the northernmost (and furthest from the FBO) runway.Of course after landing is when the real fun began. It was essential to have studied the standard taxi routes; they are in the CMAX, but I haven't found the NACO version online. This is the one I ended up using:It was important because 1) the ground controller never mentioned to use the procedure2) we had to change frequencies at the Checkpoint without prompting3) had to hold at taxiway C without being told. Since I was eye-to-eye with    the axles of all the surrounding traffic, knowing when to stop was kinda key.As I was holding on taxiway B at P I heard a NW captain say, ""Ground, I'm holding behind a ???Cirrus???"" Then he got his head bitten off for an unnecessary transmission.The markings and signage for night taxiing was very clear, as one would expect, and CMAX was invaluable for keeping situational awareness. A big concern was keeping an eye on the monsters in the area, and keeping appropriate control-inputs for any errant jet-blast (dive away from a tailwind, climb into a headwind...)Garrett, the FBO was just as Neil described, bemused at our appearance. I had called earlier and been advised there was a $70 service fee, and AvGas is Unavailable. With the fee in mind, I asked them to shuttle my friend to his car at an off-airport parking lot, which they gladly did. Then they waived the fee!Clearance delivery was business-like; the ATIS instructed to readback only tail# and squawk unless there are questions.Departure was back to the guessing game; no one was committing to a runway until I got there. They started me towards 25L, then sent me across it to 25R, then across that and I prepared for the long transit North, but then they turned me back to 25R and cleared me for immediate takeoff. Caution wake turbulence heavy 757!So LAX is doable, but you really have to be on top of your game. My friend, who isn't instrument rated thought I was being incredibly anal overbriefing the trip, but we needed just about all of it. I spoke to another friend today who went to LAX a little less prepared, and he ended up told to hold until a tug could come and pull him to the FBO. And don't come back.A few tips for anyone flying in and out of LAX:Plan ahead, no 100LL at LAX.Garrett is my preferred FBO. Mercury doesn't seem to like GA. The folks at Garrett seem genuinely amused and fascinated by the occassional small aircraft.Coming in, be prepared to be asked to locate a specific airliner (United 737) you are supposed to follow. Often there will be 2 or 3 planes in your field of sight, so be careful. Following the wrong aircraft will make ATC cranky!The biggest challenge at LAX is the taxi. Study the taxi diagram ahead of time and have it out. Note that they have two ground freq's. If you taxi from the North to the South you'll be asked to switch freq's at what is known as the 50-yardline. On the Jepp taxi diagram this is marked as ""checkpoints"" halfway down quebec or sierra.Listen closely to instructions. You are often asked to taxi somewhere and monitor tower. They really mean this. Go where they say, switch to tower, and then just wait. It may take 5 to 10 minutes before tower says anything, but that doesn't mean they have forgotten about you. Once I sat nose-to nose (er, nosewheel) with a 747 waiting. The 747 blinked first and called tower and got chewed-out big time.Bring your camera!",07:30:00,Tuesday
Experiences,3,Flying to O'Hare,https://www.cirruspilots.org/copa/member/sr_aircraft/w/copapedia/270.flying-to-o-hare.aspx,No, Roger Whittier,2014-05-13,0,"Flew into O'Hare for the first time this weekend. I enjoyed reading the post a few weeks (months?) ago from someone making his first trip to ATL, so I figured I'd post about another big airport trip. One big caveat - I flew this on a weekend in good VFR weather; presumably during the week or in bad weather, things are busier and different. Anyway, hope this isn't too boring.Contents0) Executive summary:1) Rationale:2) Preflight:3) Arrival:4) Departure:5) Fees / FBO:0) Executive summary:It's not bad at all, I'd do it again. Taxiing is definitely the hardest part of the adventure.1) Rationale:My sister-in-law lives in Chicago; the closest airport is ORD. In fact, they live on the train line (blue line) that goes to ORD. Driving or taking the train to ORD is very fast; getting to Midway is at least double the time, and getting to PWK or other airports is much farther.They just moved there last year; this is our second visit. Last time we used Midway, which was fine, but a long drive to their place.The fees were high but not TOO high (see last section), so we figured we'd give it a try to help us determine whether to use ORD or MDW in the future when we visit.To some degree, I agree with what Don Brown has posted before - that it's best for us light GA aircraft to use reliever and GA airports rather than the airline hubs. On the other hand, when the airline hub really is the best suited airport (and perhaps when city mayors close other nicely suited airports), it may make sense to do so.2) Preflight:Originally we planned to fly in Friday afternoon, which requires an eCVRS reservation (if IFR). Was very easy to get a reservation on-line, but a huge storm system in the midwest on Friday made us cancel and choose to go Saturday morning.I made sure to study the taxi diagram (note some one-way taxiways), procedures (use of a ""metering"" frequency, special instructions for entering and exiting the GA ramp), and SIDs/STARs (very difficult to meet crossing restrictions on the only SID [ORD2], at least heavily loaded on a hot day).On Saturday, when we ended up going, no reservation is required.3) Arrival:I filed VORs to Knox (OXI) then the OXI3 arrival to ORD. Both Fort Wayne and South Bend approaches in Indiana tried to change my routing to go over the lake, but I refused - I offered to go way west around Midway if they needed me to, but said I was unable for overwater flight. We didn't have any water survival gear, plus 2 kids under the age of 4 who can't swim. They ended up keeping me on the OXI3 arrival.Really no issues getting in. Assigned to runway 28, and as we were getting a few miles away from localizer intercept, Chicago Approach asked how fast I could do the ILS. I offered 170 knots until short final, and they said, ""that's great - thanks"". Told to switch to tower at WILLT (FAF), with an extra ""thanks for your help"" from ATC, so I think offering the higher speed really helped them. I had read somewhere else (AOPA Forums maybe?) that at busy times, 170 knots is the magic number between being sequenced in and being told to hold and wait.Coming off rwy 28 on the ground, tower switched me to ground, then as I neared the north runway complex, they switched me back to the north tower frequency, who got me across the north runways and into the Signature ramp. Most frequency changes on the ground, both inbound and outbound, were ""monitor xxx.xx"", not ""contact xxx.xx"".4) Departure:I had prefiled a flight plan in the morning, before brunch and hanging out with my sister-in-law. When we got to the airport, we were ready to leave about 90 minutes before my previously filed time. So I refiled via duats for a time 30 minutes in the future, and put ""UNABLE ORD2 SID RATE OF CLIMB"" in the remarks (since I didn't think I'd be able to make the crossing restrictions in the SID [3000 ft at 5DME, 4000 ft by 8DME from ORD], keeping in mind you may not even take off until over 1 DME from ORD depending on which runway you use.)When I called for clearance, they said they were ""reworking my clearance"" and told me to stand by. It took probably 8-10 mintues (this was the only real delay we encountered at any point), then they gave me a full-route clearance, but it was essentially close to my originally filed route. They also gave me the ORD2 SID. In my readback I said, ""in remarks, I said I couldn't meet the ORD2 crossing restrictions"". They said, ""yeah, we saw the remarks, no problem"". So I guess that was ""permission"" to not make the crossing restrictions, but it seemed a little weird.We called metering, and were shuttled between ground and tower and ground on our way to 22L. Controllers were all very nice - at one point they said, ""93C, hold your position right there and give way to the American MD80 to your right - no one is talking to him or knows where he's going, so just stay out of his way until he's past you"", which was a little amusing.As it turns out, after departure, I did (barely) meet the crossing restrictions for the ORD2 SID - I hit 3000 ft at exactly 5.0 nm from ORD VOR, but it was close.5) Fees / FBO:Signature is the only FBO there. The CSRs and line guys were very very nice. First time in a long time the line guy was asking me questions about the plane (horsepower, cruise speed, etc.) - maybe they don't get many singles there?There's a $14 landing fee, $14 per night parking fee. $28 ramp fee, waived with fuel purchase. Fuel is $7.57/gal, but on weekends there's $.50 off, so it was ""only"" $7.07. Yes, still very expensive but cheaper than my own home base (RDU) and only a bit more than the $6.80 reported at Midway.The biggest fiasco is a $36 ""security fee"" for the TSA security screener who monitors the entrance at Signature. You have to walk through a metal detector to get to your plane. But they don't care what you bring with you! The FBO CSR said the city makes them have TSA there, but the only thing they do is bring items like guns and knives to the attention of the pilot, who then has the authority to decide whether to bring the weapons or not.The controllers were very friendly and accomodating, although I also did my best to listen up, pay attention, and be concise and professional.Overall, the experience was very positive, and we may end up using ORD more frequently, at least when we're visiting very near the airport.In summary, using ORD rather than MDW seemed to cost an extra 10 mintues (waiting for my clearance, maybe solved by either filing earlier or perhaps next time I'll file the route they gave me this time to see if that helps), and the extra $36 ""security fee"". The other fees were about the same as most other major airports, and there were no other real delays or hassles.",07:24:00,Tuesday
Experiences,3,From CA to NY and back,https://www.cirruspilots.org/copa/member/sr_aircraft/w/copapedia/271.from-ca-to-ny-and-back.aspx,No, Roger Whittier,2014-05-13,0,"I am back at home in Fullerton after 7 day trip to NYC. Although my wife is not into heavy duty flying on a small plane, she agreed to make the trip after I installed a DVD system and set up back seat for comfortable sleeping.I planned the trip from Fullerton to NY in 1 and 1/ 2 days. I?€?d like to thank everyone for helping me with suggestions on the routing and places to stop. At the end the weather pattern has determined the final routing.To New York:Leg 1: KFUL -> KSAF 3h50mLeg 2: KSAF -> KIDP 3h 25mLeg 3: KIDP -> KSUS 1h 45m (end of the first day travel)We arrived to Spirit of St Louis airport around 6 pm rented a car and drove to hotel. Attached photos show the weather patterns during the day. Most of the weather stayed north of us and was scheduled to come to Spirit of St Louis at about 10am local time. My plan was to arrive to the airport at 8 am ahead of the weather and be on the way before the cold front arrives.Unfortunately getting up early in the morning after a full day of travel was not conducive to the safe flying. So I just turned on the other side and went back chasing my dreams. By the time we arrived at the airport the level 4 weather was on top of us with very heavy rain and lightning. After doing some planning and calculating fuel levels, I decided to fly direct from Spirit of St Louis to KCDW (Essex airport in New Jersey). The reserve was 18 gal and total trip length was planned to 4h 45m.I later realized that this was too close for comfort. As the cold front was sliding South East I had to race to get to the airport before the front arrives and in the process deal with weather deviations even though the majority of the trip was VMC. When I landed at Essex, 15 minutes later the level 3 weather arrived. Even though I was legal with reserves, emotionally it was not comfortable. In the haste of landing and looking at the mean rain shaft 20 miles north east and light showers pounding on the windows, I have landed on the wrong runway.Approaching the airport, I was cleared for runway 27, however I did not see it as I made a left turn to base, instead I saw rw27 and thought that I turned to early. I could see the numbers only after I was on a short final. At that point I thought of going around, when tower announced ?€?521JL cleared for rw27?€?. Great, shortly I was on the ground and taxing to parking. I later called the tower and discussed what happened, they told me that I was the only one in the pattern and they saw me coming in.After renting a car with ?€?Neverlost?€? we went to Manhattan and stayed there for the remaining of the trip.Few days before departure I started checking the weather and it was obvious that I?€?ll be dodging thunderstorms and other weather all the way until I am in LA basin. I decided to fly home in one day. Here is the routing I did night before the travel.Wheels up at 6am local time:Leg 1: KCDW -> KLOU 3h 45mLeg 2: KLOU -> KWDG 3h 41mLeg 3: KWDG -> KSJN 3h 44mLeg 4: KSJN -> KFUL 2h 44mPictures show that weather all the way from NY to CA will be seeded with thunderstorms and freezing level is at 17K.I would say that the most difficult weather was during the last two legs. The thunderstorms were to 40k ft and trying to stay away from them and still have forward movement was challenging.I?€?d like to thank all of the controllers on the route: They were great allowing almost any deviation without hesitating.My favorite response from the controller though, was near the restricted area from Arizona to California:Controller: ?€?Twin Cessna, I need to route you around the MOA?€?Twin Cessna: ?€?I am VMC and I can be responsible for separation?€?Controller: ?€?Twin Cessna, Stand by?€?Twin Cessna: ?€?Don?€?t worry about separation?€?Controller: ?€?I am not worried about separation, I am worried about missiles?€?Twin Cessna: ?€?I can deviate left or right as needed?€?Controller: ?€?I bet you can...?€?All in all I would not be able to navigate home if it wouldn?€?t be for XM on board and strike finder. They were invaluable in determining which direction to go. The last leg I had canceled IFR and switched to the flight following since it would be almost impossible to request deviations every few minutes.",07:23:00,Tuesday
Experiences,3,Gethereitis at FUL,https://www.cirruspilots.org/copa/member/sr_aircraft/w/copapedia/272.gethereitis-at-ful.aspx,No, Roger Whittier,2014-05-13,0,"Coming homeYesterday I had a very interesting experience flying from John Wayne (KSNA) to Fullerton (KFUL). In the morning I went to North Las Vegas to pick up a fellow member (Russ ?€? N776Y) and drop him off at Santa Ana.After a great Lunch at Mother?€?s Market I departed SNA for a 6 minute flight to FUL. Upon arrival at Fullerton and 2 minutes before my arrival another aircraft had a wheel up landing and was stuck in the middle of the runway; the airport was immediately closed.Fullerton tower started to stack people above the airport in a right hand holding pattern with 5 mi legs.So up I went to 2000ft into the race track. Within 20 minutes we had 8 aircraft circling the field. Any other aircrafts where sent away since there is no more space above the airport (Class Bravo starts at 4K)The tower was very nice and provided updates on recovery; however NTSB did not allow moving aircraft until investigation is completed.I slowed down to 76 knots, flaps down and now I have been circling for 1h and 20 minutes. Most of the other 8 aircrafts already left the airspace so now I was there all by myself. I had fuel for 3 hours before I would need to divert. 2 hours and 15 minutes later I was still circling and the plane was still on the runway, it is now dark and I can barely make up the crew working on the plane. The runway lights are turned off and airport looks deserted.At that moment I realized that I wanted to land at my home airport so bad, that I have not spent enough time looking for alternatives and selected the best course of action. I kept telling myself that another 15 minutes and the plane will be moved. With this realization, I diverted to SNA, parked my plane called my wife and was home in 45 minutes. This wakeup call gave me a new perspective on ?€?gota get there?€? disease that we experience. I did not realize how strong this disease is until I experienced it first hand.During the attack of ?€?gota land here?€? disease it was so easy to justify to wait just another minute, just another turn, just another tower update, just another gallon of fuel. This experience definitely changed the way I will approach similar situations in the future or how it relates to weather.",07:15:00,Tuesday
Experiences,3,Icing experiences,https://www.cirruspilots.org/copa/member/sr_aircraft/w/copapedia/273.icing-experiences.aspx,No, Roger Whittier,2014-05-13,0,"From Member Posts:Many times when I file IFR, knowing that there is a cloud layer let's say from 4k to 7k and temps are near freezing, I will file above the deck. However in my clearance instructions, even though I get the higher altitudes, when I depart my airport, I'm given an intermediate altitude that puts me in the freezing clouds. When I ask for a different altitude, I'm politely told that because of commercial traffic in the Northeast Corridor, I must stay in the clouds until I reach a certain VOR. it makes sense to pick up my IFR clearance at the VOR and eliminate all the fuss in between!When I first got my Cirrus in February of 2004 I left Charleston, WV going to BWI and got into ice during the climb out. The plane continued to perform normally until I got on top at 11,500' even though there was a 1/2"" coating of clear ice on the wing's leading edge. I didn't know then what I know now about Cirrus and ice (thanks to the COPA forum!) Flying in IMC over the West Virginia mountains with cold temps is a good way to pick up ice (orographic lifting?).My first time, I was forced to declare an emergency to save my butt. I was flying at 5000 over west virginia in the soup at 32 degrees. I knew I could go lower to warmer air and knew the route which I have taken 10 times now I could go down to 3000 and have plenty of clearance. At first I wasn't sure if it was ice I was seeing on the wings, but after 5 minutes of staring at it, I realized I was picking up little rock candy shaped ice crystals on the leading edge. I called ATC and said I was picking up ice and would like lower. He said no, you are at the lowest minimum altitude already. I said ok, I'll keep my eye on it and call you back if it gets worse. I was watching my airspeed like a hawk and it was steady on 120 indicated. So I waited and I watched. 10 minutes passes and now the ice is visible the length of the wing and is between 1/2"" and 1"" tall ice castles. Airspeed has dropped to 115, 5 knots. I called ATC back and said ""I am REALLY picking up ice now and my airspeed is declining, I need lower"". He STILL said NO but said I could climb if I liked. Just then I see the plane start banking to the right so I kicked off the autopilot and keyed the mike: ""I'm now declaring an emergency and I AM descending."" I descended 1000 foot to 4k and broke out. The ice ablated off in about 2 minutes but I stayed there at 4k for 10 minutes. I could see the cloud layer had risen a bit so I asked if he needed me back at 5k now that I was clean of ice. He said yes so I went ahead and climbed back up and with the higher cloud deck, I did not pick any ice back up again the rest of the flight home.A 180 at standard rate also takes only a minute to complete. If decending doesn't work and you have to make a 180 anyway you have greatly increased your exposure time as you have to fly back. A 180 almost always works, descending depends on the circumstances. The safest bet here would have been to do both; if the descending 180 took you into the clear, then you have the option to resume your course (VFR if you are below the MEA's). I would NEVER try to climb out of icing in an SR20; there really is no excess power available once the drag is increased.AOPA Icing VideoTKS Anti-Ice System",07:12:00,Tuesday
Experiences,3,Inadvertant spin,https://www.cirruspilots.org/copa/member/sr_aircraft/w/copapedia/inadvertant-spin.aspx,No, Eharrison,2013-08-16,0,"Let?€?s get this out of the way right up front I already know that I was a moron, idiot, dummy, stupid - take your pickI already know that I wasn?€?t thinking I already know that I was very very lucky. Trust me this really got my attention - I have done a lot of analysis of my decision making procedures and learned a lot about myself personally - the way my mind works or doesn?€?t work and my attitude about the inherent risks of flying. I only report this because I think I might have done something ralmost nobody has done before and I lived to tell about it and rI think there are some things to be learned from this.rrrContentsrNice BreakfastBright IdeaThe StallDecisionRecoveryWhat did I Learn?Nice BreakfastIt was a nice Saturday morning, I had agreed to take a non-pilot friend up for a couple of hours just for fun. We headed north because that?€?s where the pretty country is from Phoenix. We ended up landing at Sedona for breakfast. Sedona is a beautiful place to fly into but it?€?s a non-controlled airport and it?€?s busy on a Saturday morning. Most pilots prefer to land on runway 3 and depart on 21. After breakfast we were at the runup area for runway 21 waiting for a couple of planes to land on 3, I had already run thru my checklist and done the run-up and was ready to takeoff, it was hot so I opened my door while we waited. My takeoff window finally opened and onto the runway I went and off we go, within a few seconds it was clear that I had forgotten to close my door (this wasn?€?t my first time), yea I know what the POH says to do but I wasn?€?t going back to SEZ just to close my door. I decided we?€?d stop at Cottonwood about 15 minutes away. In the mean time I figured I?€?d slow down and try to close the door without landing, I?€?ve tried it before but never after I had slowed and I figured I?€?d try a slip into it or a slip away from it, as you already know I couldn?€?t close the door.Bright IdeaThen I got the bright idea, since I was already at 80 knots with 1/2 flaps I would demonstrate how nicely the Cirrus handles a power off stall, something we have all done 100s of times. I reduce the power and watch the speed bleed down, I?€?m ready for the recovery - I?€?m thinking pitch down-full power - keep coordinated - I watch the ball - I watch the airspeed - I point out the buffet and explain what?€?s happening - I?€?m primed and ready to recover when the nose breaks. The StallExactly when the break comes my door flies open, not just a little but all the way to the stops - this catches me so completely by surprise that I let go of the controls and grab the door to keep it from being ripped off the plane while at the same time going to full throttle with my right hand - this was an unconscious reaction based on the fact that I had already programmed myself for the recovery. I feel the right wing start to dip and I step on the rudder but in the next instant we are upside down with the world going around in circles - I hold the rudder to the floor while the plane makes 1-2 turns and suddenly it changes direction, this change was surprisingly violent, I stomp on the other rudder peddle and very quickly the plane violently switches back to spinning in the original direction. I have lost interest in my door and it?€?s now flapping like a bird and I don?€?t really care if it stays attached. DecisionAt this point I very clearly remember thinking ?€?THIS ISN?€?T WORKING, START OVER FROM THE BEGINNING --- POWER TO IDLE?€? I look at my right hand and notice that I was still at full power and think to myself ?€?THAT?€?S REALLY STUPID?€?, I pull the power back and then think ?€?NEUTRALIZE THE CONTROLS?€? I look at my left hand to see if I am hanging onto the controls-I?€?m not and then I think ?€?OPPOSITE RUDDER?€? and about that time it quit spinning, I gently raise the nose-add power and turn back to DVT forgetting my plan of landing to close the door.RecoveryI nonchalantly said ?€?that was pretty cool?€? and my passenger said ?€?that was really cool what was that?€?, I answered ?€?that was a spin?€?. Jake asked if I practiced those and calmly I told him that everyone had to practice stalls but we should really also practice spins and I apologized if I had scared him too much to which he answered ?€?I looked over at you to see if you were scared you were as calm as a cucumber so I figured everything was under control?€? -- ignorance really is bliss. Start to finish something less than 10 seconds and about 1000 feet of altitude.What did I Learn?More than I can really list here but some of the biggies are:I learned how freaking fast things can go to hell in an airplane.I learned not to take any phase of the flight lightly, I knew the door was open and I should have followed the POH ?€? slowed down and landed as quickly as possible ?€? forget the demonstrating stalls until the plane was in a condition to be flying.I learned that just like most planes the Cirrus will spin in an instant (yea I know you have to be uncoordinated to spin, I was coordinated until I got distracted and forgot to fly the plane)I learned that just like most planes the Cirrus will recover from a spin if you follow the correct procedures and you have enough altitude.I was happy to learn that in a real life and death emergency I didn?€?t scream all the way to the ground, I was able to logically apply my knowledge to solving the problem ?€? at least this timeI was NOT happy to learn that in an emergency it is possible to become so task-fixated that you get tunnel vision ?€? I never thought about CAPs until after it was all over ?€? I?€?d like to think that if the plane wasn?€?t responding to my input I would have given up and used CAPs but I honestly don?€?t know that for sure. People can ask how the guy with his family in Northern Arizona could flat spin all the way to the ground last month, I can tell you how and it scares the poop out of me thinking about it.",19:35:00,Friday

The ole boy upstairs was ""riding with us on this one""... consider myself very lucky.A few years ago I hit a bird of unknown type about 5000' MSL at night. That'll wake you up!

Experiences,3,Landing in a crosswind,https://www.cirruspilots.org/copa/member/sr_aircraft/w/copapedia/277.landing-in-a-crosswind.aspx,No, Roger Whittier,2014-05-13,1,"It was a windy day so I thought I?€?d get in some crosswind landing practice at Whiteman (WHP), my home base.Wind was 360 at 20, runway 30 in use. No problem, I?€?ve landed in wind like this many times.Because of my superior aeronautical skill the first two touch & go?€?s were non-events. Not my prettiest landings but safe and well within my comfort zone.The third landing went similar to the first two until just before touchdown. On each landing the tower would give me wind checks on downwind, base and final. This time I had to wrestle with the wind a little more, adding some throttle here and there to keep from plunking down hard on the runway. This caused me to touch down about 3/8 of the way down the runway instead of within a third of the runway, as usual. I also carried a little extra speed because of the wind. So I?€?m on, and aligned with, the runway centerline. Throttle closed and then touch down. As I pat myself on the back for another nice crosswind landing I feel the airplane lighten up and weathervane about 45 degrees to the right. This causes the tires to screech as the airplane skips along the runway almost sideways. Before I could react to this strange turn of events another gust of wind lifts the airplane about 5 feet off the ground and turns it a little more to the right. I immediately firewall the throttle but the stall warning is still screaming as I drift off the left side of the runway while pointing to the right. This all happened within about 3-4 seconds. I level the nose about 10 feet above the ground (I?€?m no longer above the runway) in order to gain airspeed and execute the balked landing. Now I?€?m thinking I need to get back to the centerline of the runway but as I turn even more to the right the whole picture looked just?€? weird. And besides, I was clawing for more airspeed, but got the ?€?sensation?€? of less airspeed (actually it was slower ground speed) as I turned more into the wind. The slower ground speed fooled me into thinking I was flying slower so I lessened my angle to the right and felt a little better even though I was being blown off to the left again. I didn?€?t dare take the time to look down at my airspeed indicator. I already knew I couldn?€?t raise the nose, the stall warning was loud and constant. I couldn?€?t lower the nose to gain airspeed, I was only 10 feet off the ground. I just kept the plane level and waited for the airspeed to build as I watched the trees, power lines and 2-story building at the end of the runway getting uncomfortably close. I?€?m only 10 feet off the ground but the stall warning won?€?t shut up. I?€?m now experiencing a great deal of fear?€? OK, make that mind-numbing terror. Something is terribly wrong here, I?€?m not gaining airspeed. I should be climbing out at 75 kts by now. If something doesn?€?t change quickly I?€?m going to be on tonight?€?s news. No doubt about it.As soon as my mind hit the word ?€?change?€?, I realized I hadn?€?t retracted the flaps to 50%! Damn, how could I be so stupid!!?? So much for my ?€?Superior Aeronautical Skills Award?€?. Ok, half flaps, the stall warning fades away but now the trees, etc. are REALLY close. I can now glance down at my airspeed. I?€?m still only doing 60-65 knots. Every ounce of my being wants to pull up to insure obstacle clearance but I know that will end up in a stall. I force myself to stay level to build airspeed to 75 kts. Finally at 75 kts I pull up and climb out safely. I?€?m guessing the entire ordeal only lasted about 6-8 seconds from touch down to 75 kts. It felt like a lifetime. It was the first time in over 1,000 hrs, 20 years of flying and 1,600 landings that I felt I was in any real danger.Here?€?s my personal debriefing and what I learned:There were no indications of gusting conditions, either from the ATIS, the tower?€?s wind checks or my previous two landings. All wind was reported at about 360 at 18, sometimes up to 22 (not gusting to 22).I should have aborted the landing when I passed the first third of the runway.I neglected to fly the airplane until it?€?s tied down. When I touched down I thought I had it made and wasn?€?t prepared for a gust of wind.No matter how odd ?€?the picture?€? looks, do what you know to do. That is, do whatever it takes to maintain directional control even if it means flying a ?€?picture?€? you?€?ve never seen before. Crabbing 60-70 degrees off runway heading would look and feel very awkward but, in fact, would have given me a slower ground speed and more time to gain airspeed.MY BIGGEST MISTAKE?€? allowing the ?€?weirdness?€? (that?€?s the only way I can describe it) of the situation to cause me to neglect to raise the flaps to 50% immediately after full throttle. My continued fixation on the crab issue and my airspeed issue contributed to my neglect of the flaps.",06:58:00,Tuesday
Experiences,3,Like a deer in a headlight,https://www.cirruspilots.org/copa/member/sr_aircraft/w/copapedia/like-a-deer-in-a-headlight.aspx,No, Eharrison,2013-08-16,0,"Well, I thought it would happen one day but not on IFR flight with controller screaming. I was flying to Lodi with my son to do some skydiving. Passing Burbank as I headed north-west I was climbing to 12K. Once leveled off I leaned the engine and settled for 1.5 hours of cruse. Six miles ahead of me I saw a target on the metal detector heading toward me. No big deal, except it was hovering 400-300 ft bellow me. Sure enough ATC announced, Cessna 12 o?€?clock, 11,500. I kept looking, but to no avail, too hazy. So I told my son to keep looking and that we will not see it until one mile ahead of us. ATC kept asking and I kept saying ?€?Aircraft not in sight?€?.Well I finally saw it, right in front of me head in 25-50 ft bellow. And that where fun begun. For some reason I froze in disbelieve that this plane was heading right at me. For time that seams eternity to me now, I was trying to figure out ?€?How can it be??€? and ?€?Is it really true??€?. When I finally recognized that it is true and he is heading right at me, I did sharp 30 degrees turn right and initiated a steep climb. 10 seconds later, twin engine Cessna passed bellow me what seemed to be to close for comfort. I got on the radio and announced that I deviated for traffic, to which controller screamed ?€?CIRRUS 521JL DO NOT DEVIATE FROM CURRENT HEADING, CESSNA IS WELL BELOW YOU?€? for which I responded ?€?As a PIC I am final authority of this plane, 521JL turning back on course?€?. And ATC 5 seconds later ?€?521JL report back on course?€?. The rest of the flight was normal.The surprise to me was how I did not want to believe that Cessna was flying right at me and it took me almost 5 -10 seconds to make the decision to deviate. Wow?€? that was nasty surprise. The more I think about Ilan more I can appreciate his state of mind and split second decision to pull the chute. I can now also relate to the departure stalls and engine failures. You have to act fast, but your mind does not want to believe that something is actually going wrong. I figure talking out loud should help ?€?This guy is flying at me, DEVIATE!?€?",19:43:00,Friday
Experiences,3,Low bases: a Garmin 396 TAWs CFIT save story,https://www.cirruspilots.org/copa/member/sr_aircraft/w/copapedia/279.low-bases-a-garmin-396-taws-cfit-save-story.aspx,No, Roger Whittier,2014-05-13,0,"It was CPPP time and I was planning to spend 3 days at KCCR (Concord, CA) and absorb as much material as possible. Few days before, my wife informs me that she wants to take her folks to Muir Woods in San Francisco, followed by a concert. What date, I asked. Sure enough it was the same weekend as CPPP.No problem I said, thinking, I go for one day for CPPP fly home, pick everybody up, fly to KOAK (Oakland) drop them off, back to KCCR sit on lectures, back to KOAK and spend the evening with my family at a concert and fly home the following day.Arriving to KOAK was uneventful with bases at 1900ft. I arranged rental car for my folks and Lola to drive to Muir Woods and set out to fly back to Concord. Checking weather, the overcast was at 1900 ft in both airports. I looked at the map and decided to go VFR at 1400ft direct KOAK to KCCR. I figured, IFR will take at leaset 30 minutes. I did not look close enough at the elevation to realize that there is a small 1000ft hill right in my path. In addition, Class B at 3K. Everything looked pretty easy on the ground.Departure was uneventful, right turn, direct to KCCR, flight following at 1400ft. Within few minutes, as I got closer to the hill, the visibility started dropping very quickly. Alright I thought, just stay at this altitude, the [METAR] at KCCR showing 1800, so I should clear in a few minutes. Just then, my Garmin 396, Garmin #2, and TAWS went crazy ?€?Terrain, Terrain, Pull up, Pull up?€? and then again ?€?Pull up?€? much more insistently.I throttled up 10 degrees climb and was at 2200ft in a jiffy in full IMC.

Experiences,3,"Miami to Fortaleza, Brazil",https://www.cirruspilots.org/copa/member/sr_aircraft/w/copapedia/280.miami-to-fortaleza-brazil.aspx,No, Roger Whittier,2014-05-13,0,"""This article is based on a COPA Forum post.ContentsCrossing the equatorEquipmentRoutingSide tripsNotes on BrazilCrossing the equatorMiami to Brazil is a reasonably simple trip as the weather you are about to traverse has only one main danger and that is hurricane activity. No icing. No mountain ranges (unless you cross Venezuela/Brazil via Mt. Roraima).EquipmentAs Doug Ritter points out, for such a long over-water trip, survival gear is essential. My list included:Raft (Winslow Island Flyer)PLB (McMurdo's PLB bought at the Cirrus store)Waterproof bag (bought at West Marine)Dry food (bought at WalMart)Water (also WalMart)Laser flare (Magnum 72-hour from Aircraft Spruce)First aid Comprehensive kit from Adventure MedicalRoutingOn JeppView the most direct routing is not via Manaus, but as follows:KMIA or whichever airport in the Florida coast. We departed from KFPR in an SR20, and the plane had greater range than we did.MBPV (Providenciales) - 502.1 nm - an easy flight over the Bahamas. We slept at the Comfort Inn. Very comfortable, two blocks to the beach, great pool, and adjacent to a strip mall with three restaurants.TJIG (Isla Grande airport in Puerto Rico) - there is a Cirrus service center here - 400.3 nm - you can go to Saint Maarten if you prefer...TVSV (Saint Vincent - Granadines U.K.) - 425.6 nm - last week we did not stop at Saint Maarten because you now are OBLIGATED to have a handler. The handlers wanted to charge us $250 to give us a ride to the main terminal. It used to require no handler in Saint Maarten. - we stayed at the Grand View hotel. Awesome views from the island and the airport.SYCJ (Georgetown, Guyana - dutch) - 435.3 nm... don't know much about this one...SOCA (Cayenne, French Guyana) - 365.9 nm - (if you bypass SYCJ it will be 723.9nm the longest leg - your call, the SR22 can handle it). Don't stop in Venezuela, you will pay $50 for fuel and $600 for landing fees. Trinidad will require you to hire a handler for a lot of $$$ and walking.SBBE (Belem, Brazil) - 439.0 nm - your Airport of Entry into Brazil. Nice city, good food, good hotels. About $120 landing fees for US aircraft. No need for handlers, go straight into Immigration. Arrive daytime.SBFZ (Fortaleza) - 613.2 nm - your destination. Pinto Martins airport has an ILS approach, 8,000ft runway. I was there three weeks ago delivering my former Mooney 201 to its new owner. I can put you in touch with a Hangars there. You will need one, as the airports in Brazil charge a different rate based on whether you part at the Manoeuvering Area or Parking Area. The Parking Area is very remote and the locals don't recommend leaving the aircraft there. Hangar rates are cheap, about $20/day, $50/week.Side tripsIf you carry a life raft, plan on making the trip to Natal (SBNT) - 234.3 nm and to Fernando de Noronha (SBFN) - 208.8nm. Natal has the most beautiful beaches in all of Brazil with white sand dunes, warm water and so on. Fernando de Noronha has the best diving sites.On the route, between Belem and Fortaleza you can stop at Sao Luis (SBSL). It is a very beautiful, old Portuguese city, built in the 1600s and fully restored. Great airport, ILS (not that you need it - no mountains, sea level). Cheap!! One of the UNESCO World Heritage cities, like Cartagena in Colombia and Guanajuato/Puebla in Mexico.Notes on BrazilThere are no FBO services as in the US, although hangars can be rented on a daily or weekly basis. Signature has a few hangars in a few cities, they charge dearly and cater to big business jets.Fuel is paid usually in cash (Brazilian Reais). In Fortaleza fuel is about R$4.50/liter (~US$10 /gallon)! So, plan your cash outlay.Most Brazilian ATMs work with Cirrus and Plus cards. They do have a limit though, about R$1000 per weekday and R$100 per weekend day or evening. In Belem they may accept US dollars, but don't count on it elsewhere. Besides, you will get a bad rate. Better to use plastic.Landing fees are paid in cash (Brazilian Reais only). No plastic. Plan, plan! Don't run out of cash.If you get your hands on a JeppView TripKit for South America, you can play more easily with your routings.""",06:48:00,Tuesday
Experiences,3,Scottsdale to Palo Alto in the SR22,https://www.cirruspilots.org/copa/member/sr_aircraft/w/copapedia/282.scottsdale-to-palo-alto-in-the-sr22.aspx,No, Roger Whittier,2014-05-13,0,"As the founder of a software company and a huge tech enthusiast, I?€?m always intrigued by the number of startups in the Silicon Valley area. Every time I visit the area, I?€?m jealous of the environment and advantages that companies starting in Silicon Valley have over companies anywhere else in the world. I decided to spend a week in Palo Alto, the heart of Silicon Valley, to hang out and see what it?€?s like.Being eager to try out my new Cirrus on a long-distance trip, I decided this would be a great solo trip to test out both the plane and my new piloting skills. Planning for the trip, I realized Palo Alto?€?s airport has the smallest runway I?€?ve ever seen at 2400 feet. Of course, with the SR22?€?s landing ground roll of about 1200?€?, that leaves plenty of space for an experienced pilot, but I?€?m not an experienced pilot, so the runway length was a definite concern.I decided to practice short approaches at my home airport, Scottsdale (KSDL), noting the amount of runway space I use. Since Scottsdale?€?s airport has an 8,200?€? runway, I had never noticed how much of the runway I eat up on my landings. The first time I took note, I realized I had used 3,000?€?. Wholly smokes! That would put me right into the bay at Palo Alto. I definitely needed another try. But as soon as I got serious about landing in a short distance, it seemed easy to get out at less than 2,000?€?, so I felt I was ready for my trip.I had my fantastic CSIP instructor (he?€?s reading this, so I have to be complimentary ;-) review my flight plan. Once he gave the thumbs up, I felt good to go.The 3-hour 15-minute trip itself was extremely smooth. I obtained flight-following from ATC and listened to XM radio to pass the time. One thing I realized is that for long trips, you definitely need sun-screen! The sun can easily burn your skin and there?€?s not much you can do to avoid it. I ended up using my Cirrus shades on the side window to avoid burning (I know, I know, that?€?s not a good idea when you?€?re flying VFR, but having traffic watch and flight-follow and peaking every now and then for traffic, I felt it was a safe decision).The Approach into KPAO!The airpsace around KPAO is a huge mess. It?€?s surrounded by Class D, C and B airspace that makes it quite tricky to get in there. But having done my homework, I was pretty confident that my route of going East of San Jose (Class C) and turning left into Palo Alto would be ideal (see the red lines in the image below).Unfortunately as soon as I had descended to 4,500?€? near San Jose, ATC informed me that I needed to go West of San Jose, not East and that I should make an immediate turn to the West (see the green lines in the above image). That through a big monkey wrench into my plans, especially since the terrain West of San Jose is quite mountainous. I decided to climb to 5,500?€? to avoid the terrain and slowed down to about 100 knots. I then obtained clearance through Moffett Federal?€?s airspace, but the clearance was given at or below 1,500?€?. Here I was at 5,000?€? less than 3 miles from Moffett?€?s airspace and I needed to descend fast. So I put on full flaps and slowed to 80 knots! I dropped like a tank (thankfully!) and reached the desired altitude of 1,000?€? as I finally spotted Palo Alto?€?s tiny runway.I was cleared straight into Runway 31, so I enjoyed the scenery as I passed over Stanford?€?s campus and set myself up. The approach couldn?€?t have been better. I landed right on the numbers proud that I could easily make the 2nd turn off of the runway when all of a sudden my engine quit. I had previously put the engine into idle as I had landed but in my haste of avoiding airspaces and the change of plans by the ATC, I had forgotten to turn on my fuel boost. Turning on the fuel boost is part of the pre-landing descend checklist. Why that would cause the engine to quit, I have no idea. It seems that there should be more room for error, but I informed the tower that I?€?ll need more time on the runway as I have to restart my engine. They were cool with it and fortunately, the engine started right up on the first try. Lesson learned!The trip was very enjoyable and a big confidence builder as it was the first time I had taken a long 3-hour solo trip, about 550 nautical miles. One pleasant surprise was that my entire trip used only 57 Gallons of fuel, leaving me with 35 gallons (or about 2 hours worth) still on-board. Not bad at all!",06:46:00,Tuesday
Experiences,3,SR22 cockpit noise measurements,https://www.cirruspilots.org/copa/member/sr_aircraft/w/copapedia/281.sr22-cockpit-noise-measurements.aspx,No, Roger Whittier,2014-05-13,0,"I had a 2 hour flight today and decided to do some noise measurements. The Idea was to measure cabin noise level as a function of RPM and then once RPM stops changing, monitor MP.The graph bellow show very interesting results. The noise level is minimum at 2630 RPM, for any other settings, the noise level is higher. Also notice that at 2500 RPM the noise level is the highest. The overall noise level changed by 5dB as I swept from max RPM to 15 inch MP.After that I adjusted my engine to 2630RPM and kept it this way all the way home. When I started descending from 11K to 8K at 500ft /min without changing any other settings, the noise level increased by 6 dB, when I leveled off the noise level went back to 100dB.",06:44:00,Tuesday

I've been waiting for a chance to try it out... today was the day.First, the end result:File Lost, searching... The process is memorable mostly for the painstaking planning it required. First, I imported a plan view of the SR22 copied from the POH into Google Earth. Next, I had to find a place to ""put"" the plane where I could fly around its perimeter without encroaching on anyone's airspace... and which was likely to be pretty free of deviation-causing traffic... etc. I selected an area just north of Dagget Airport, over the low ground. Finally, I had to generate a series of waypoints to define the outline - in the end I had 29, complete with a lat/long for each. Then I got to load these into the GPS - a 1/2 hour process that is hard on the fingers. Finally, I got to fly the thing... and learn some lessons for next time (or for the next person to try it).Those lessons are... (1) The pattern (airplane or whatever) needs to be a LOT bigger, to minimize the effect of radius turns on the result; (2) No pussyfooting about the turns! These need to be as ""sharp"" as they can safely be flown - a compromise of low speed (for tight radius) and enough speed (for safety) is called for. It's pretty clear from the result that I started with the right side of the airplane - the left side shows the benefit of experience.Thanks to my friends Paul and Stephanie Balsamo for their good company and support - this made for a fun afternoon! Here are more photos of this flight - which I described to ATC as a photographic mission. Well, I *did* take photos... and besides, I couldn't very well describe it as the ultimate gratuitous use of an airplane... and their time!",06:41:00,Tuesday

Hangars and tiedowns,3,High wind tie down,https://www.cirruspilots.org/copa/member/sr_aircraft/w/copapedia/320.high-wind-tie-down.aspx,No, Roger Whittier,2014-05-13,0,"In the American southwest, winds with gusts up to 50 or 60 knots, combined with loose sand, can turn the airport turns into a sand blaster. Unless you have a hanger, you need to take defensive measures to protect your Cirrus from wind damage. Polyurethane paint can handle a lot of abuse; the key is to protect the acrylic surfaces - the windshield and windows - from scratching.Winds are typically strongest during frontal passage. Plan ahead if a moving front is forecast.ContentsPositionSecureProtectAnti-StaticPositionIf possible, tie-down in a sheltered spot behind a structure (a hanger or a control tower) downwind of the forecast wind. If structures are unavailable, tie-down downwind of other aircraft. They will dissipate energy and absorb some of the airborne sand before it gets to your aircraft.Always tie down your aircraft into the wind. A 60 knot wind hitting the aircraft from the rear will cause the control surfaces to flap, with high likelihood of damage to control surface.SecureTightly secure your aircraft, with minimal slack in the tie-down chains or ropes. Slack tethers can allow strong gusts to move the aircraft and jerk at the tie-down rings.ProtectGet a good plane cover and secure it well. Pull the cover as tight as possible against the windshield so it cannot flap and scratch the acrylic or allow sand to abrade it.Cirrus canopy covers often have a long section across the cockpit door without any straps. In high winds, the untethered portion can flap and scratch the pilot and copilot windows, if it is not tightly strapped. Use an extra tie-down strap (available at any hardware store) for additional mid-fuselage protection.Anti-StaticThe combination of low humidity, wind and sand introduces an electrostatic charge on acrylic surfaces. This charge attracts fine particles of dust to the plastic. During a wind-storm the dust will cling to and abrade the acrylic under the canopy cover. Such abrasion can be significantly reduced by using anti-static cream, such as the one offered by Micro-Surface. If you park the aircraft outside, apply the cream whenever you expect significant dust and wind. A little bit goes a long way.",06:28:00,Tuesday

This nut will ?€?sit?€? on one of the studs that was used for the spring; the stud will fit into the hole. It?€?s important not to compromise the threaded inside of the nut.3. Chamfer the top of the stud by filing a 45 degree slope around the top. That will allow it to penetrate farther into the hole and seat better.4. Test-fit the nut. It should be able to rotate freely on the stud.5. Use the aluminum stock to fashion a ?€?cage?€? to hold the nut. The nut must have freedom of movement around the stud, but not around the axis of the threaded rod.Use sheet metal screws to secure the bracket to the tow bar.The bracket was 5?€? long before bending.The holes for the threaded rod must be oversized ?€? at least 5/8?€?.6. Prepare the opposite bracket from the aluminum stock. This bracket is simpler. This hole should be at least 3/4?€? diameter.7. Attach the simple bracket to the opposite side of the tow bar.

COPA members have had good things to say about both companies and their products. If you have a raised track or lip to cross at the hangar door, some have reported that the Aero-tow can have difficulty crossing that area without additionl assistnce by the operator. I have personally owned a gasoline Powertow 40 EZ for 11 years, and love it. I just purchased my second 40 EZ about a month ago to use at my other hangar.-Jim DoutKeep your tires properly inflated!If you have an incline or lip to get over, Aero-Tow has a larger model. Most Cirrus owners don't need it. I have a fairly significant lip at the entrance to my hanger, and the smaller Aero-Tow works fine. From time to time I do have to give it a nudge just as the wheels hit the lip, but it is not a big deal.I think a fundamental decision you have to make is whether you want to go electric or gas. Since I have electricity in my hangar and use a Gatts jar to return sampled fuel to the plane, I decided to go electric. I am impressed with the quality of the product as well as the business ethics of Terry, the owner of the company. You can usually find Terry and his products at Sun N Fun, Oshkosh, and the Migrations.That said, I have not seen complaints from Power tow owners here. - Todd CarollTry the E-200,power tow from AERO-tow, 920-648-8114. -Buster OffuttI use an old riding lawn mower with a home made towbar to attach. These old riders are very inexpensive I have 2 one in Fl one in NH, one was free the other was 150.00. Most small engine repair shops have a few of these units out back that have varying degrees of problems. Most of the problems are with the mower deck you'll throw that part away. Just spend an afternoon in the garage fabricating a towbar, removing the mower deck, making attaching points front and rear on your tug and you are set to go. I have been using my homemade tugs for 5 years, they are great for towing the plane to the fuel pump or in and out of the hangar. I hate starting the plane to taxi a short distance then shut down- fouled plugs. If any one is interested I'll post pictures.If you have a choice of standard shift or hydrostatic shift get the hydrostatic. Don BelisleI have been thinking of converting a golf cart as a tug but the riding mower sounds like a less expensive solution.-Doug MorleyAs others have said in the past ""If you can afford an SR22 (and a hangar) you can certainly afford a..."" I consider the Power Tow the best airplane related purchase I've ever made. I probably wouldn't fly nearly as much without it. You can save enough money for one just by skipping some flights while you nurse your shoulder back to health. They only cost $1100 (used to be under $1000) and maybe you can even find a used one for a lot less. - Dave Freemanhttp://www.powertow.com/40ez1.htmlDepends on your hangarIf the lip is low then the E200 is great and simple to use The Lil Sherman is way to big and bulky for a Cirrus. I used an E200 for years and liked it, then I changed to the Power Tow 5 hp because my new hangar had a large lip on ot and the E200 did not have enough power. I have to say, I really like the Power Tow. It had a lever that allows one to hook up to the nose wheel and not have to bend down under the plane to do it. Great feature. Mason HollandI placed my new SE 22 in service last week. Bought a Lil Sherman at Sun n Fun. It's an animal! Works like a charm. Terry, the owner of Aero Tow, is super nice, helpful and stands behind his products. I know nothing about the E200, but the Lil Sherman gets the job done with power to spare. Mike BrownI know the E200 quite well, and for most use, it seems plenty powerful enough. If I bought it, I'd *definitely* get the dolly, because moving it around only under its own power is too slow.Mike Radomsky ComparisionI suggest you consider the Powertow Thundervolt as well - I prefer it, although they're both great units. I agree with others - Terry at Aero Tow is a sweetheart and very nice to deal with. My preference for the Powertow has to do with several things not mentioned in this comparison that I posted a while back:1) The single wheel makes for easier maneuvering2) It has a lever for hooking up and removing that does not require you to bend down (the E200 has a crank mechanism, low down)3) Although the E200 has the advantage of providing a spare 24 volt source... it's really not the right way to go for a ground power unit.Michael Radomsky Tug ComparisonAeroTow E200Aero Tow E20024 volts vs. 12 for the PowerTow, so can double as a Ground Power Unit with an easy mod (Stephen Shirley has a good writeup and photo of this)The folks at Aero Tow are amazingly responsive and just super NICE to deal with.The direct-drive system is robust, but it cannot be run at anything but one very slow pace. Anything other than moving the airplane the length of the hangar is like walking with your legs tied together.The AeroTow now has optional free-spinning mini-wheels ron the back that allow you to drag it around at whatever speed you can run. I retro-fitted mine. http://www.aero-tow.com/e200retro.htmThese wheels are not suitable for moving the tug more than a few dozen feet, though, while the Thundervolt can easily be moved at a brisk pace on its large tire when in neutral gear.Powertow ThundervoltPowertow ThundervoltEasier to connect to / disconnect from the airplaneEasier to maneuverFreewheels (neutral gear) so easier to move on its own...no problem walking hundreds of yards with it.Not as mechanically robust as the AeroTow - many clutches, chains, gears, and things that might need to be tweaked.",00:34:00,Tuesday

Powerplant operation,3,Cold starts,https://www.cirruspilots.org/copa/member/sr_aircraft/w/copapedia/cold-starts.aspx,No, Eharrison,2013-08-16,0,"ContentsrSR22SR22 Priming SB changesSR20Cold starting damage and engine pre-heatSR22the SR22 calls for priming 15 seconds or 60-120 seconds depending on SB and serial #.rSR22 Priming SB changesThe early SR22's did require 60-120 seconds of priming before a optional SB was issued to change it.rthe premise was that FAA regs REQUIRE that inadvertently hitting prime in flight could not flood and kill the engine (generally a bad thing  ). So a circuit insured that once the fuel pressure reached ""prime"" pressure levels it automatically cut it to boost. The net effect was you really never got more that a micro second of prime and really might just as well have opened the throttle and mixture and hit boost and finished your interior checklist - then started. Worked the same. The SB changed that and allows full prime until the engine oil pressure reaches a pressure that can only be achieved by the engine running (like 20 lbs or something like that). Best optional SB I ever paid for. Living in the southwest, I routinely primed for 30 seconds in the summer and a minute in the winter before. Now I do 3 seconds, much more and you you can flood it quickly.In addition to the SB for the fuel pump (which applies to early model SR22s), there is an SB for the intake manifold drains which improves cold starts. I recommend you also ask your SC about that one. SR20If the engine is cold-soaked, I use the following procedure for that plane:rThrottle and mixture full open""Blip"" the primer 10-12 times. That is, apply the primer and watch the fuel flow meter. It will usually rise then quickly fall again (i.e. ""blip""). After it falls, continuing to prime does little good, so stop for a second, then re-engage the primer and repeat 10-12 times. If the plane is REALLY cold, maybe more than 10-12 times. If the plane is only moderately cold (say 40-50 degrees) then probably more like 6-8 or 8-10 times.WAIT 20 SECONDS for the gas to vaporize, THEN pull the trigger.Then close the throttle, or maybe just barely crack it open. Leave mixture at full rich, turn on the boost pump (not prime but boost).Crank. That should do it. If nothing happens, try priming 2-3 more shots (""blips"") and repeat.The reason the ""blipping"" is necessary is because on that vintage of SR20, the fuel pump switches out of ""prime"" mode automatically whenever the fuel flow is above some low value. Even though you still have ""prime"" engaged, it's not really priming anymore.Newer SR20s have a different mechanism - for newer planes, prime really primes unless the oil pressure rises (i.e. engine starts) - then the pump switches out of prime mode even if you're still pressing it.You can get the newer SR20 behavior by applying optional service bulletin SB20-73-02, but I never found it necessary - for me, the ""blipping"" was always adequate and just slightly more of a pain than holding down the prime button continuously.FWIW, that plane already has another cold starting SB applied, SA-01-08-R1, which replaced the ""port drain connectors"". It was REALLY hard to start cold before that SB, but after applying the SB and following the procedure above, I haven't had any problems.I don't prime nearly as much as you. But I think the key is having the throttle open JUST A SMIDGE. More than that and you will flood her out. I also bump the throttle up in increments when she starts running, which is often a sputtering attempt. I have caused her to quit in the past by trying to quickly get the rpms upImportant: First check your log book to find out whether you have upgraded to the ""improved starting kit"" or not.rIf not, go ahead and have it installed. Older SR20s not necessarily have this feature. It really helps a lot.Cold starting damage and engine pre-heatSome believe that a cold start (e.g. engine mass below 30-40 degrees F) is one of the worse things you can do to an aviation engine, and that a engine pre-heat (hangered, tanis heater, or propane pre-heat) is vital to avoid engine damage until the oil warms. believe that a really cold start is nearly the worst thing to do to an engine. I will not start if left in the cold below freezing for over 2 hours after running unless pre-heated. The picture in my mind of the metal rubbing across itself is like a continual shrill fingernail rubbed against a blackboard for hours. I do not know where 30 or 32 comes from. Oil does not freeze at the same temp as water.rI agree cold starts are hard on aircraft, but I have watched the planes at the Edmonton Flying Club get started at -25C, or even colder. And they almost always go well past TBO.rI stick to the -10C that Continental recommends, although the issue hardly ever comes up in that my Cirrus is hangered.Here is one datapoint that may (or may not) be valuable. Back when I was taking my Private training, the flight school managed 45 piston aircraft. Their rule was that the temp had to be 25F or above for the previous three hours, or a pre-heat was required. I am more conservative than that with my (former) Cirrus, but that is the rule they used.While you're waiting for your Tanis you could lay a couple of light bulbs on the engine block, cover the cowling with a blanket and plug up the cowl air inlets with towels. Unless it gets down in the low teens you should crank right up, provided your battery is healthy.http://www.aerothermheaters.com/",19:05:00,Friday

The program has now become very sophisticated and users need to spend time reading through the help information in the program. It is also possible to download a PowerPoint demonstration illustrating most of the features.Both Avidyne and Arnav MFD's store up log information of your flight and the files with this information can be downloaded either onto a zip drive or a USB thumb drive (USB thumbdrive for Avidyne Revision 6 or later). The Avidyne will download separate log files with names like Engine_ 070314_131315_out.log and lots of others which you can ignore. Transfer the log files to a folder on the hard drive of your computer for storage. The Arnav downloads a single file with the extendion .CDF: this file contains loads of log files that need to be split up.

Powerplant operation,3,In-flight LOP Magneto Check,https://www.cirruspilots.org/copa/member/sr_aircraft/w/copapedia/253.in-flight-lop-magneto-check.aspx,No, Steve Lucas,2015-04-16,1,"""The standard pre-flight engine run-up check in the Cirrus checklist is adequate to flag a non-operating magneto, reveal badly fouled plugs or uncover a significant fault in the ignition harness. It can not detect more subtle problems with the ignition system. In contrast, a properly executed in-flight mag check provides more comprehensive information and is more likely to uncover small problems before they become large.Since in-flight engine diagnostics involve a potential for engine stoppage during flight, read this article in its entirety prior to conducting an in-flight mag check. Your aircraft's POH is the definitive guide to engine operation.ContentsAdvantagesProcedureCautionAbnormal IndicationsBest practicesIn-flight LOP Magneto CheckAdvantagesA diagnostic in-flight mag check is run at max cruise power while operating lean of peak (LOP). This is the most demanding regime of flight for the ignition system; it takes more effort to ignite a lean fuel mixture than a rich one. It uncovers minor problems well before the much lower power ground runup or during a rich of peak mag check in flight. As with the ground check, the in-flight mag check tells you when a mag is inoperative. However, mags as well as the other components of the ignition system generally don't die without warning. The in-flight check picks up early evidence of plug and ignition harness problems. It reveals not just that a specific mag (which includes six spark plugs and wires) is running rough but also which cylinder the problem is related to. (The problem cylinder is the one on which the EGT does not rise equally during the check.) That provides your A&P to focus on the affected cylinder and the top or bottom plug (depending on which mag).Also, unlike high RPM operation on the ground, there is no potential for gravel-related prop damage.ProcedureAn in-flight mag check is conducted in a fashion that is similar to a ground mag check except you are running at the max cruise power setting for your altitude instead of only 1700 RPM, the mixture is set to lean of peak operation and you will run the engine on each individual magneto longer than you ordinarily would during a ground check. The following step-wise procedure assumes LOP operation and EMax engine monitoring.Switch to the EMax page on the MFD and press the Normalize button to zero out the EGT readings.Turn the ignition key two clicks anti-clockwise to switch to the right mag and immediately release the key.Observe the EGTs: they should all rise and then stay steady. Give them a good fifteen seconds to do so. If one or more does not rise, make note of them. You'll likely have roughness if this is the case, since all the cylinders are not putting out the same power.Now turn the key one click clockwise (to the right). This engages the left mag. Again, immediately release the key and observe the EGTs for about fifteen seconds or so. They should stay risen and should be reasonably steady.Finally, click again to the right and now both mags are operating.CautionIf when switching to either mag you see all EGTs drop and feel a loss of power, do not immediately switch back to Both. (That's why you let go of the key after switching - to avoid the reflexive reaction to do so.) Leave the throttle alone and fully lean the mixture. Then switch back to Both and gradually bring the mixture forward.If the engine decides to die, you have a failed mag or a failed wiring system from the mag. Do not panic! Leave the mag switch on the dead mag for a few seconds. Put the mixture control to idle cut off. Return the mag switch to both. Slowly advance the mixture until the engine relights. Do not change the throttle or any other engine settings.CHTs will slowly decrease during the in-flight mag check. RPM should not change. Slight roughness on one LOP mag is normal. The amount of rise in each EGT is not important. What's important is that they all rise and stay fairly steady.Abnormal IndicationsEGT does not rise on one or more cylinders when a single mag is selected (on a normal mag test, EGTs should rise about the same amount - although they may or may not have started at the same absolute temperature, the temperature increase for each should be about the same - because with only one plug firing per cylinder, the flame front takes longer to propagate and burn the full fuel/air charge. Even though the combustion is delayed, the exhaust valve still opens at the normal time, so the exhause is hotter than normal as it passes the EGT probe). Most likely cause - fouled, failing or failed spark plug in that cylinder. If the ignition harness has more than 1,000 hours on it, a worn or damaged ignition lead becomes increasingly likely to be a suspect (ignition harnesses rarely fail all at once). It is unlikely that the magneto is a suspect as most mag problems manifest themselves on all cylinders, although there is a remote possibility of carbon tracking affecting just one ignition lead.Note: Left mag fires the top plug on cylinders 2, 4 and 6; the bottom plug on cylinders 1, 3 and 5.No change in EGT indications. Most likely cause, broken P-lead, so the mag is always on. After you land run the engine at low idle, turn the mag switch off and leave it there. If the engine continues to run you have a hot mag. Shut down the engine with the mixture (make sure the fuel pump is off) and be especially careful around the propeller and have the problem repaired immediately.EGTs rise uniformly, then, after several seconds, one begins to drop. Most likely cause, failing spark plug; sometimes it takes a little time for the problem to manifest itself.Best practicesThe following practices have been collected from COPA posts:Do an in-flight LOP magneto check once on every flight, for example, right before starting the descent. That way, any problems can be addressed before the next flight.Perform the LOP magneto check near airports with a Cirrus Service Center.If an in-flight mag check is part of the pre-descent check-list, on the next flight, the mag check on run-up can be avoided. Remember, the last mag check was done less than ten flight minutes before! Switching to each mag to see that it is running may be sufficient. However, always run through the standard check-list after any maintenance.You will get clues to mag failure in flight by watching your EGTs. If they all start to rise for no reason and no power setting is changed, that is the most likely cause. There may or may not also be some engine roughness.""",01:03:00,Thursday

The Avidyne Emax software has modes that support this operation, described in the Emax POH.As an engine is leaned, one by one all of the cylinders will reach their peak EGT. If you're lucky, this will happen at nearly the same time, but the fuel flow spread between the mixture setting where the first cylinder peaks and the mixture setting where the last one peaks will vary from aircraft to aircraft. Generally speaking, a spread of less than 0.5 GPH is needed for smooth operation LOP.When you keep leaning after all cylinders EGTs have peaked, you'll be running LOP. The extent to which an engine is running LOP is measured in degrees F. For example, ""running 50 degrees LOP"" is running with an EGT that is 50 degrees F cooler than the EGT of the last cylinder to peak.Many owners have looked closely at the engineering issues underlying those recommendations, and have changed their operating procedures to incorporate LOP in other flight regimes. Excellent explanations of these issues appear in John Deakin's body of Avweb columns. To really understand this it is best to read them all (and it has taken many owners multiple passes to really get it). A great place to start is with his 4-part series Where Should I Run My Engine? He is also one of the featured speakers at the Advanced Pilot Seminar on engine management.",10:26:00,Sunday
Powerplant operation,3,LOP operation,https://www.cirruspilots.org/copa/member/sr_aircraft/w/copapedia/254.lop-operation.aspx,No, Roger Whittier,2014-05-13,2,"""NOTE: The specific fuel flow values listed below are for the IO-550 installed in the SR22. Different values are appropriate for the IO-360 installed in the SR20.ContentsTAXITAKEOFFCLIMBLEVEL OFFBIG MIXTURE PULLFINDING PEAK EGTSETTING MIXTURE USING THE RED BOX TABLEHIGH POWER LOP MAG CHECKDESCENTAPPROACHCHECK LISTSTAXIAfter start, and after the engine has warmed up for 2-3 minutes, lean the engine until a rise in RPM is noted. You know you?€?re in the right place if any further leaning results in roughness. Maintain this setting for taxi and runup (yes, runup), going to takeoff rich setting as you?€?re taking the runway. For taxi, you should be leaned ?€?brutally?€? enough so that any attempt to set full throttle will result in the engine stumbling. (No, this will not hurt your engine ?€? only your ego!)TAKEOFFThe MFD should be on the EMAX page for takeoff. Use FULL RICH or set fuel flow according to the POH table for the pressure altitude. After application of full power, watch for all 6 EGT?€?s to rise in concert, and ?€?sweep?€? the EMAX?€?s engine ?€?gauges?€? to ensure all are in the green. During takeoff, note fuel flow. At sea level, you should be getting at least 28 GPH (for the SR22). If not, get your shop to adjust your fuel flow to obtain at least 28 GPH. If they balk, get another mechanic.CLIMBJust after takeoff, press the Normalize button the eMax page. You are capturing the takeoff EGT, which you will maintain by gradually leaning during the climb to altitude. I do this at 500?€?, and then switch to the MFD Map page, where I have the engine monitoring block displayed.During climb, watch the display of normalized EGT. As you climb, the numbers will display increasing negative values (-10, -20, etc.). What you want to do is to maintain ?€?0?€?. If you see negative numbers, you will lean the mixture. (I think: ?€?minus means pull the red knob back, plus means push the red knob forward.?€?) Note that a bug in the MFD software exists such that any time you are at a normalized zero the engine data block will display dashes ---- for all three parameters! So until this bug is fixed you are actually trying to maintain ?€?dashes?€? instead of zero.This bug was fixed in version 2 of the MFD software.If you are given a step-climb intermediate level-off, pitch to level off and note your fuel flow. Then do a ?€?Big mixture pull?€? (see below) and just leave it in that safe state until you get your clearance to resume climb. Then enrichen the mixture back to the fuel flow you had noted, and refine it to again maintain that normalized ?€?0?€? EGT as you climb.LEVEL OFFWhen reaching your final cruise altitude, level off and leave everything alone until the airspeed stabilizes. This seems to take a good 2-3 minutes in the Cirrus. Then position the power lever / RPM as follows:{| style='color:green;background-color:#ffffcc;' cellpadding='15' cellspacing='0' border='1'| 2000?€?  ||2500 RPM (Max MP at 2500)|-| 4000?€?  ||2600 RPM |-| 6000?€? or above ||2700 RPM |}The IO-550 is perfectly happy running at 2700 RPM all day long. This is where a good noisecanceling headset pays off! For running LOP, you generally want to be WOT: Wide Open Throttle (or as wide open as the above RPM guide will place you).BIG MIXTURE PULLThe so-called ?€?Big Mixture Pull?€? is a means of setting the mixture control to ?€?park?€? your engine in a safe place. This will place your engine well lean of peak by moving rapidly ?€?through the mountain?€? of peak temperatures and pressures to a safe place on the lean side. To perform the Big Mixture Pull, pull back on the mixture control smoothly and fairly rapidly until you feel the airplane decelerate. Stop! You?€?re there. The pull should take about 5 seconds or so. Do NOT enrichen a little when you feel the deceleration. At altitudes below 10,000 this usually results in a fuel flow of about 13-14 GPH. Less if you?€?re higher. Any time you want to park your engine in a known safe place, such as before finding peak EGT or for level-offs during climb or decent, just perform a Big Mixture Pull.FINDING PEAK EGTSince you?€?ve just done a Big Mixture Pull after leveling off, you?€?re done with maintaining takeoff EGTs for your climb, so switch back to the MFD?€?s engine page and press the Absolute button. Give the engine a minute or two until the EGT?€?s stabilize. Now we?€?ll use the eMax?€?s ?€?Lean Find?€? capability to find peak EGT, but we?€?re doing it from the lean side of peak rather than the rich side. This is better for two reasons. First, the power curves are steeper on the lean side of peak, so you?€?ll be spending less time in the ?€?red box,?€? and second you are looking for the first cylinder to peak rather than the last, also resulting in less time spent in the red box. Press the ?€?Lean Find?€? button and begin slowly enriching the mixture. Watch for the first cylinder to peak (it will turn blue on the screen). (When I say ?€?first cylinder, I do not mean cylinder #1 ?€? I mean whichever cylinder reaches peak first! You?€?ll likely find it will be the same one every time.) When that first cylinder peaks, immediately press the Normalize button to ?€?zero?€? that cylinder at its peak EGT. Then pull the mixture back lean again to a ?€?safe?€? place well lean of peak, or, once you?€?ve gotten familiar with the ?€?red box,?€? you can usually lean pretty close to what will be your final setting.SETTING MIXTURE USING THE RED BOX TABLEThe ?€?Red Box?€? table depicts the ?€?edges?€? of the red box, based on the amount of power you are producing. The ?€?Red Box?€? defines a region where higher internal cylinder pressures, and the resulting higher cylinder head temperatures, may result in decreased engine life. The limits of the red box are defined in terms of degrees rich or lean of peak EGT, and the ?€?width?€? of the red box changes depending on how much power you are producing (NOT altitude). So to set your mixture so as to respect the red box limits, you first need to know, at any point, how much power you are producing. You can then look at the table, find the row for that percentage of power, and make sure you are at or outside of the limits shown for that amount of power. For example, if I?€?m developing 70% power, I can look at the table and see that for that power setting I need to be 125 degrees rich of peak or richer, or I can be 25 degrees lean of peak or leaner. It shows me that at 70% power the area between 125 ROP and 25 LOP is to be avoided ?€? that?€?s the red box at 70% power.So the red box is ?€?wider?€? at high power settings, and smaller or nonexistent at lower power settings. As a matter of fact, a look at the red box table will show you that at 60% power or less, there is no red box, so you can put the mixture control anywhere! (More on that momentarily.) Here?€?s another way to look at it. Same information. Maybe we?€?ll call this the ?€?red fin!?€?NOTE: For a ?€?red fin?€? graph suitable for use with the IO-360 engine in the SR20, see SR20LOPRedFin.So now that you know how to get the EGT limits from the table, you need one piece of information to set your mixture control: ?€?How much power am I developing??€? Lean of peak, the answer is surprisingly easy, because when lean of peak, power is directly proportional to fuel flow. It turns out that you can simply multiply your fuel flow in GPH by 15 to obtain horsepower.Dividing your horsepower by 310 (for the SR22) yields percent power. To make this easy, the red box table does this for you. Find your fuel flow in the third column and look over to the first column to find your percent power (interpolating if necessary). So the table tells me that if I am lean of peak and my fuel flow is 13.5 GPH I am developing 65% power.You can use the ?€?red fin?€? graph?€?s horizontal axis for this purpose as well. Note that the eMax display of percent power may be way off when LOP! IGNORE IT! Use the red box table (or that factor of 15 and a whiz wheel), not the eMax display, when LOP. So how do you use all this knowledge to set your mixture in flight? Easy. Here?€?s an example. Assume you?€?ve leveled off, done the big mixture pull, found peak EGT and normalized there, and have leaned again back to the safe region.You will use the normalized reading from the first cylinder that peaked for this procedure. Ignore the others. Let?€?s call this cylinder the ?€?key cylinder.?€? Look at your fuel flow and find where it is in the table. So let?€?s say your fuel flow is 13.5 GPH.You can quickly see from the table that you?€?re developing 65% power. Now look on your eMax page and see where your normalized key cylinder is relative to peak EGT. Let?€?s say it is showing -40. The red box table says you must be at 0 degrees LOP or leaner at 65% power (in other words, ANY setting at or leaner than peak EGT is OK). Well, you are! You are out of the red box on the lean side by 40 degrees (-40 is less than 0). So if you want to develop more power but still stay out of the red box, you can.So you can enrichen the mixture, let?€?s say to 14.5 GPH. A glance at the table says you?€?re now developing 70% power. Say you look at your normalized key cylinder and see it now shows ?€?25. You look at the table and you see you?€?re done. Your -25 degree LOP setting is right at the red box limit for 70% power.If that key cylinder showed -30 at 70% power, you could even be a bit richer if you wanted to max out your LOP power. But if you went to, say, 15.6 GPH and the key cylinder showed, say, -10, ouch! You?€?re inside the red box, because at 15.6 GPH = 75% power you must be at -40 degrees LOP or leaner and you?€?re not!At higher altitudes, your engine will not be able to develop more than 60% power. So where do you set your mixture at high altitudes? The answer will depend on the mission being flown. If range isn?€?t an issue and you want to ?€?go fast,?€? a setting of 50 degrees RICH of peak will always result in the most power and thus the highest airspeed. Peak EGT is going to give you almost the same airspeed but will save a little fuel. For ?€?go far?€? (economy & range) I use another MFD page ?€? the trip page. Switch to the MFD trip page, and, assuming your destination airport is the final fix, look at the ?€?fuel remaining?€? value for your destination. If the fuel remaining at destination is less than your comfort level for the conditions, lean the mixture until the fuel remaining value suits you.(Leaning to idle cutoff to get truly spectacular remaining fuel is not recommended, however!). For IFR reserves, put your alternate airport and the course to it in your flight plan and use the trip page as described to ensure adequate fuel.HIGH POWER LOP MAG CHECKThe very best way to test your ignition system is to perform a high-power lean of peak magneto check. The typical ground mag check is next to worthless in terms of really testing your ignition system and plugs. Sure, it will tell you if a plug is completely fouled or not firing, and that?€?s what it is for. But to really test your system, perform a high-power LOP mag check in cruising flight. First, switch to the eMax engine monitoring page. Press the Normalize button to zero all EGT?€?s. Then switch to one mag and observe the EGT for each cylinder. Let 20-30 seconds go by. Don?€?t rush it ?€? you?€?re not hurting your engine at all. All EGT?€?s should rise, and by similar amounts (which will be quite a bit more than they will during a ground mag check). If a cylinder?€?s EGT doesn?€?t rise, or rises somewhat less than the others or exhibits erratic indications, you?€?ve found a problem (likely a bad or marginal plug) and you?€?ll know exactly where the problem is. Perform the same test on the other mag.DESCENTIf you?€?re running LOP and you?€?re ready to descend, you can leave the mixture control right where it has been in cruise for the descent. As you descend, the mixture will gradually become leaner, and you?€?ll gradually become increasingly lean of peak and you?€?ll be developing less power. In smooth air, it works out just about right to keep you out of the yellow arc at a 500-700 FPM descent. So for typical descents, do nothing with the red knob! If you?€?re descending from higher altitudes (>= 10,000?€?), you may find that you need to enrichen a bit as you get to lower altitudes so as to keep the engine running smoothly. If I get a level-off during descent, I?€?ll either leave the mixture where it is or simply do a variation on a Big Mixture Pull to ?€?park?€? the engine in a safe place during the level-off.APPROACHIn the approach phase, I?€?m still leaned, and I leave the mixture right where it is as I reduce to my approach maneuvering speeds (I use 19?€? MAP). With all this said, it must be noted that this is merely an overview of the ?€?how?€? of LOP operations. A good understating of the ?€?why?€? is really required to get the best performance out of your airplane and, especially, to understand how educated interpretation of the eMax engine monitor can save your engine, and possibly your hide. I strongly urge you to attend the Advanced Pilot Seminar course. It will be the best two days you?€?ll ever spend with regard to understanding and operating your engine. http://www.advancedpilot.comCHECK LISTSTAXIMixture ....................................LEAN BRUTALLYTAKEOFFMixture ......FULL RICH (or per POH for altitude)CLIMBPower Lever.............................FULL FORWARD500 Feet AGL ......................EMAX NORMALIZEMixture ....................MAINTAIN NORMALIZED 0Step-Climb level off:Fuel Flow ...................................................NOTEMixture ................................BIG MIXTURE PULLResumption of climb:Mixture .................SET TO NOTED FUEL FLOWPitch..........................................................CLIMBMixture ....................MAINTAIN NORMALIZED 0CRUISEPitch..........LEVEL OFF UNTIL A/S STABILIZESPower Lever / RPM ...................................2000?€? ..............................................2500 RPM4000?€? ..............................................2600 RPM6000?€?+............................................2700 RPMMixture ................................BIG MIXTURE PULLFinding peak EGT (from lean side):MFD................................................EMAX PAGEEMAX................................................ABSOLUTEWait until EGT?€?s stabilize ( ~ 1 minute)EMAX............................................LEAN ASSISTMixture ..............................SLOWLY ENRICHENWhen first cylinder peaks:EMAX..............................................NORMALIZEMixture ..............LOP or ROP per Red Box TableDESCENTPitch....................................................DESCENTPower Lever.............................AS NECESSARYMixture .................LEAVE AT CRUISE SETTINGIf engine roughness encountered:Mixture ..................ENRICHEN UNTIL SMOOTH""",00:04:00,Tuesday
Powerplant operation,3,Low oil temperature solution,https://www.cirruspilots.org/copa/member/sr_aircraft/w/copapedia/256.low-oil-temperature-solution.aspx,No, Roger Whittier,2014-05-12,0,"As many of you have experienced also, we have had problems with low oil temps in the SR22. Even the winterization kit failed to raise them sufficiently.We removed the vernatherm (the aircraft oil temperature equivilant of a liquid cooled ""thermostat"") and checked it in hot water with a claibrated thermometer and it checked out fine according to the temps stamped on the unit.See the attached pic where it says 170FFigure 1Figure 2One clue that I pursued and asked Cirrus and TCM about repeatedly related to fairly rapid oil temperature changes.We would be flying along on a wrm day and the oil temps were maybe 150F... then they would jump to 190F in a few moments. We'd have hot oil temps in the middle of winter one moment and the next thing they'd be cool.I figured the vernatherm might be sticking. I got my SC to buy us a new one and install it ourselves.Problem solved. We now run oil temps right at 180F to 210F all the time regardless of the OAT or phase of flight. Never above, never below.It is my opinion that the vernatherm was sticking. (just like car coolant thermostats would stick back in the old days when quality control was not as good as it is today.)So, I'd suggest that any of you with these low oil temp problems consider replacing the vernatherm. By the very design of the system and the placement of the temp sensor the oil temps should not be as low as we have been seeing them.QMy oil temp has been running a consistent 166 degrees. So yesterday I had my SC change out the vernathem for a new one. I noticed on the top of the vernatherm is stamped ""173 degrees"". One would think that it is designed to open and allow oil to go to the oil cooler at 173 degrees, thereby not allowing the oil to get up to 180 degrees.AIt's a lot more complex than that. You need to understand that as oil flows through the engine's oil system, it is cyclically heated (by splashing against hot things like the insides of the pistons) and cooled (by passing through the oil cooler. The ""oil temperature"" is actually about a 40F range of temperatures, depending on exactly where in the oil circulation cycle you measure.The oil temperature probe is normally at the COOLEST point in the oil system, NOT the hottest point. If the gauge reads 160F, then the hottest oil temp is roughly 160+40 or 200F, which is not quite hot enough to boil water at sea level (but is hot enough at altitude). We like to see indicated oil temps in the 180-200F range, which means that the hottest point is in the 220-240F range, which is hot enough to purge water under all conditions..",23:59:00,Monday

I like doing whatever is legal myself......gives me a chance to inspect everyting else that is visual. I love this SR20!- Al ODonnelI  really love to see owners do their own oil changes, especially on aircraft like the Cirrus SR2x where there's minimal access to the engine compartment during pre-flight. I like to think of an owner-performed oil change as a golden opportunity to actually lay eyes and hands on the powerplant, looking to see if anything is leaking, chafing, burning, etc. I think of it as ""advanced pre-flight.""- Mike BuschHere is one more great tip, unrelated, that I got from my service rep yesterday. If you change your own oil you know how difficult it is to keep from making a mess when you remove the oil filter. Here is a trick. Take an awl and punch a small hole in the top of the filter before you start draining the oil. This will allow the oil in the filter to drain out of the filter. No, you won't lose any trace metal in the paper filter as particls are trapped there and the oil that drains out of the filter drains from the other side (inside) of the paper filter.- Bendrix BaileHere are the data from my two most recent oil changes.rShop 1: 1.5 hours at $65/hour, total cost $161.68 including 8 quarts of oil and new oil filter.Shop 2: 2 hours at $65/hour, total cost $152.95 including new oil filter (I supplied the oil).- Roger Freedman",19:12:00,Friday
Powerplant operation,3,Oil filler venting to reduce crankcase condensation,https://www.cirruspilots.org/copa/member/sr_aircraft/w/copapedia/260.oil-filler-venting-to-reduce-crankcase-condensation.aspx,No, Roger Whittier,2014-05-12,0,"BackgroundWater condensed in the engine crankcase can cause corrosion and rust in aviation engines. The problem is worse in cold weather combined with many short trips, and worse for the SR20 than the SR22 . Corrosion is a major problem in aircraft engines, particularly those that are not flown very frequently. Eliminate the moisture and you eliminate an essential element to corrosion.  Symptoms include a foamy or milky residue on the dipstick, or rust/corrosion on the dipstick and in the oil filler tube.Some owners make it a point to ventilate the crankcase as soon as possible after landing by opening the oil filler cap and allow the water vapor/steam to escape. Some vent for only a few minutes, then replace the cap, others leave it ajar to ontinue venting.q: i notice that when i check the oil it has lots of condensation creating a foamy residue on the dipstick.... it has been cold -6 to -25 and we performed many short legsProcedureRight after I land, I open up the oil door, take out my dip stick about 10 inches and prop my oil door down on the dip stick lid and keep it that way till the next day in my hangar. Prior to that I was getting this yogurt like light brown crud up on the oil filler and ice when it was cold----so this lets the water out and it has cut down on the ""crud"" I get.I just pull the dipstick out a few inches after landing to let crankcase vent. If I am around for a little while, 10+ minutes, I just leave the filler door open and button it all up before leaving. If I leave right away, then I close the door, but leave one of the two latches open to make sure that I do not forget to fully close the dipstick before my next flight.Another approach is illustrated here (see CAUTION below):Oil temperature needs to be at least 180 F in order to have adequate water evaporation from the engine oil; oil temperatures in the SR22 run very low.Allowing the condensation to vent from this natural chimney (the oil dipstick and filler tube) is a solution to water in the crankcase. Keep in mind for every gal of gas that goes through the engine, a gal of water is created. Blow by products of combustion (past the piston rings) allows some of this water to enter the crank case. That which is not boiled off and out through the crankcase breather system lingers after shutdown. In relative terms, to what is actually created, it isn't much but the best final resting place is at the top of the dip stick. By removing or at least cracking enough to allow condensation to vent, it may even help prevent corrosion in the crankcase as well.CAUTIONIf you elect to leave the dipstick out for a time after shutdown to vent the crankcase, be sure you have AN IRONCLAD ROUTINE for ensuring it is replaced properly before the next flight. This may not be a good practice for shared-ownership planes. Some people leave a rag with a ""REMOVE BEFORE FLIGHT"" tag in the oil filler door when they vent the crankcase. Failing to put the dipstick back in could lead to a loss of oil in flight and an engine shutdown!",23:54:00,Monday
Powerplant operation,3,Percent power,https://www.cirruspilots.org/copa/member/sr_aircraft/w/copapedia/261.percent-power.aspx,No, Roger Whittier,2014-05-12,0,"ContentsOverviewWhen Rich of Peak EGTWhen Lean of Peak EGTNote re: Avidyne MFD %Pwr PresentationOverviewIt is very straightforward to calculate the percent power being produced by your engine. To do so, you need to know if you are operating Rich of Peak EGT(ROP) or Lean of Peak EGT(LOP).When Rich of Peak EGTWhen you are ROP, there is plenty of fuel in the mixture, and air is the limiting factor for power production. So, to calculate percent power you merely need to calculate the percent of airflow compared to the maximum available. For the normally aspirated planes, 100% power is 27"" of manifold pressure and 2700RPM. Thus, percent power is computed:Percent Power = (Manifold Pressure)/27 * (RPM)/2700Horsepower = Percent Power * 310 (SR22)Horsepower = Percent Power * 200 (SR20)When Lean of Peak EGTWhen LOP, power is proportional to fuel burned, as there is plenty of air, so you can determine percent power by taking 14.9 times the fuel flow and dividing by the horsepower rating of the engine.Horsepower = 14.9*(Fuel Flow in gph)Percent Power = Horsepower / 310 (SR22)Percent Power = Horsepower / 200 (SR20)Example:If at 11Kft the fuel flow set to 12.7gal/hr on SR22 thenHP = 14.9*(12.7gal/hr) = 189.23HP %Power = (189.23/310)*100 = 61%The multipier 14.9 is based on the IO-550N's BSFC of .39 and the weight of AvGas of 5.85lbs/gal:(5.85lbs/gal) / (.39lbs/hp-hr) = 14.9hp/(gal/hr)Note re: Avidyne MFD %Pwr PresentationIt should be noted that prior to the SR22 Turbo (TN), the Avidyne ""% Power"" calculation is incorrect when LOP. It is valid ROP but wrongly incorporates MP and RPM into its LOP calculation and cannot be relied upon. The calculation is correct in the SR22 Turbo; it is not known yet if it will be corrected in the Normally Aspirated aircraft.The figures in the POH performance section giving % power based on RPM and Manifold Pressure are correct and correspond to the ROP calculations above.",23:52:00,Monday
Powerplant operation,3,Pitot heat on ground,https://www.cirruspilots.org/copa/member/sr_aircraft/w/copapedia/262.pitot-heat-on-ground.aspx,No, Roger Whittier,2014-05-12,0,"Can a pitot tube can be damaged by running the pitot heat ON (for an extended period, not just a quick check) during ground operations?This is certainly a problem for some types of pitot tube.I had occasion to dig into this question for OUR pitot tube, after a mechanic accidentally left mine on for a long time. Finding the right people to talk to was a bit of an odyssey. Here's what I learned.Our pitot head is commonly known as part number AN5812-1, manufactured by Aero Instruments in Cleveland, OH. The ""go-to"" person there is Ryan Mifsud, who knows everything you can think of asking about pitot tubes, and then some. The phone number is (216) 671-3133.Their internal part number is the PH502. The ""AN5812-1"" derives from an Army Navy part numbering convention that dates back to the 1940's.This pitot head is also used in many bizjet applications; the heating system is more than adequate at jet speeds with an OAT of -64 dC, keeping the pitot head at a minimum of +100 dC. In order to be THAT effective, the pitot head gets really, really hot if it is switched on in still air (like during a preflight). In fact, within about 10 minutes, the pitot surface will reach a temperature of 900 dF - more than enough to melt solder, for instance. Certainly NOT a good idea to test by switching it on and touching it. They know of instances where people have been badly burned when they've changed their preflight routine... switched on the pitot heat, then been distracted for a few minutes before doing the touch test. (I test mine by switching it on momentarily and noting the increased load on the ammeter; for me, that's evidence enough that the pitot heat is working).MTBF is around 50,000 flight hours! If the pitot heat is accidentally left on in still air, after about 40 minutes the chrome plating on the head will start to discolor. There is no other effect on function, although Ryan estimated that the heater element's life may be reduced by 10,000 hours or so - leaving 'only' 40,000 hours of useful life. If the pitot heat is left on long enough to cause the chrome to blister, the underlying metal will fall victim to corrosion, and then all longevity bets are off. At the relatively low speeds we fly, the head gets hot enough to vaporize water/ice on contact.",01:06:00,Monday

Powerplant operation,3,Red fin,https://www.cirruspilots.org/copa/member/sr_aircraft/w/copapedia/264.red-fin.aspx,No, Roger Whittier,2014-05-12,0,"""The 'Red Fin' (aka Red Box) refers to that portion of aviation piston engine powerplant operation where cylinder pressures exceed manufacturer's recommendations. John Deakin or APS came up with the term red box in his avweb columns. The red box has then often been called red fin, because a certain graphical depiction of the phenomenon rather resembled a fin.The Red Fin is a sacred icon for the Church of LOP operation.Gordon Feingold in 2003 took the tables of fuel mixtures, fuel flow rates, and produced a chart of allowable engine operation at various mixture settings (LOP, ROP) vs fuel flows, derived from information developed by John Deakin in his AVWEB articles, APS, and GAMI. The part of that chart in which maximum cylinder pressures might exceed manufacturer's recommendations is called the 'Red Fin', and is to be avoided. These are areas of peak EGT, leaning for best power, where fuel flows generate more than 75% rated power.Full Rich engine operation uses excess fuel to cool cylinders, and prevent too high cylinder pressures.Note: When LOP you can determine percent power by taking 14.9 times the fuel flow and dividing by the horsepower rating of the engine. This is based on the IO-550N's BSFC of .39 and the weight of AvGas of 5.85lbs/gal:(5.85lbs/gal) / (.39lbs/hp-hr) = 14.9hp/(gal/hr)COPApedia article on Lean Of Peak engine operationSR20 IO-360 Red FinSR22 IO-550 Red Finhttp://www.advancedpilot.com/""",01:00:00,Monday

What does it mean. Am I at risk if I make a few more flights with it in this condition?Location of the temperature dot is shown above.Answer:The black dot means your brakes have over heated enough that the O-ring may have expanded. If it does, after the brakes cool there is a chance that the O-ring may cause hydraulic fluid to leak. There is some chance that that would mean no brakes when you need them. There is also a chance that the heat from the brakes ignites the brake fluid which results in a real nasty fire. Both the wheel pants abd the strut are fiberglass and once they catch fire - it spreads quickly. There were a couple of bad fires caused by this condition which caused the modification which adds the tel-temp (black dot).Pre-flight inspection shows that brakes were not overheated.With an inspection dot showing that the brakes have overheated, your brakes need to be inspected. Your SC will put in new O-rings put and a new sticker will be put on.Notice that O rings are damaged and will leak fluid.Black dot = no-goThe airplane does not pass the preflight inspection criteria Cirrus has published in this condition. The brakes are a no-go until you have them fixed. Any mechanic can do it, but if you need to take it to a service center I suggest you get a ferry permit so you can legally fly it.One thing to check is if the sticker is ""black"" or ""gray"". If the sticker is not the same color as the black writing on the sticker or black border around the color change area, you just may need a new sticker. If you haven't run your finger over it to make sure it's not dirt, I would try that. If it's still black, definitely get it serviced.Ambient temperatures are largely irrelevant as the risky temps can only be reached by a hard braking event, or more likely, riding the brakes.Use caution during taxiIt's tough to overheat the brakes after a landing; but easy if brakes are dragged during a prolonged taxi. If you suspect that your brakes may have overheated, keep moving, to keep as much airflow as possible over the brake and wheel assembly. This should minimize chances of a fire.Most brake overheats have been the result of dragging the brakes while taxiing without realizing it. It's easy to do. All it takes is very light brake pressure and a long taxi. Taxiing with too much power is also a big factor - the POH now limits you to 1000 RPM on level taxiways.",04:32:00,Sunday

Defueling is inherently dangerous due to the flammability of Avgas. The composite frame does not readily dissipate static electricity, which increases the chance of sparking. Thus special caution is needed when defueling a Cirrus.Essential readingBefore attempting defueling, it's incumbent on a pilot to understand risk factors and to take appropriate precautions, as nicely documented here.CleanlinessClean hoses and storage receptacles are essential to minimizing debris in the fuel system. Even when supposedly trained FBO staff are in charge of the operation, ensure that they are not using disintegrating hoses or grungy containers.Inadvertently ending up with a mouthful of avgas is also a concern, though it has been posited that COPA Pilots are far too smart to allow that to happen. If you know your peers too well to believe that, consider using a product similar to the SuperSiphon.Storage and disposalAs long as it's clean, any gasoline-approved container will do. Avgas does oxidize over time, so fill the container as much as possible to minimize interaction with air. But leave a little room for heat expansion. Speaking of heat, ensure that the storage area is cool (under 80F/26C) and away from direct sunlight.If you need to dispose of Avgas, consult your airport office or local fire department for options. Do not put deteriorated Avgas in the plane, down the drain or into groundwater.""",00:45:00,Monday

Next do a very through preflight. I look at every screw/fastener I can see. Then I move the control stick/wheel while carefully looking at the surfaces themselves to ensure they all move appropriately and freely.Once I'm satisfied with the preflight (and that includes the paperwork to ensure the plane is legal for flight) I do a full runup on the ramp. This includes a mag check and avionics check. I then shut down and carefully look for any leaks under the cowl.Once I'm satisfied that the plane will probably fly, I ask for a high speed taxi on the runway. On the way to the runway I check brakes, heading indications, and do a complete pre takeoff check. My home airport's longest runway is 7000 feet so I simply line up, apply takeoff power and ensure all engine parameters are in the green. Pay special attention to fuel flow and, if equipped, each cylinder's CHT and EGT. Once I get to just under takeoff speed I cut the power and abort. If you don't have access to a really long runway it may be better to simply take off rather than risk an abort but with 7000 feet I prefer to check everything and then stop. After my abort I taxi to an area where I can shut down and again check for leaks.If all is well I then depart with a request to orbit the airport at about 2000 feet. Once up there I set about 60% power and loiter while I turn round and round while testing everything in the airplane. This is where I turn on the autopilot and check it's functioning. If all looks good I ask to leave the area and come back in on the ILS which I do with the autopilot to check coupling.Make sure the log books are updated and do not fly with them, leave them in the car or give to someone. I would look at every screw and bolt and take my time to do the preflight, don't rush to be anywhere. Too often something is not tightened. Do a very complete avionics check including the autopilot by the book. I would do a full speed down the runway since CMA has a long one to make sure you are developing full power. Next time when you do take off have Oxnard set ""Direct To"" in case you have a problem (this should be SOP anyway). Stay in the area with in glide distance of CMA until you were satisfied that all is well. Circle the airport for 15 - 20 minutes. Go from cruise to approach config, several times.Check the Brakes. You must check both sides (pilot & co-pilot). Make sure both peddles depress evenly and get hard.The most important thing about a post-maintenance test flight: NO PASSENGERS! Required flight crew only, which for the SR2x is one pilot.The one exception to the no-pax rule is if you can persuade your A&P to accompany you on the test flight. Personally, I think A&Ps should be REQUIRED BY REGULATION to participate in the first flight after maintenance. It would give them excellent incentive to double-check everything before approving the aircraft for return to service.But unless you can sweet-talk your mechanic into riding shotgun (rotsa ruck!), the post-maintenance test flight needs to be a strictly solo operation. The incidence of mechanical problems during the first flight after maintenance is (ahem) disturbing.The key is to take your time.

Stick and rudder,3,Brakes,https://www.cirruspilots.org/copa/member/sr_aircraft/w/copapedia/243.brakes.aspx,No, Roger Whittier,2014-05-11,0,"Some Cirrus owners have experienced brake issues:premature brake wearfailures due to o-ring overheating,in a few cases, fires after prolonged brake use while taxiing.In response to brake issues, Cirrus introduced:an available brake upgrade with more robust brakes, andheat-sensitive stickers that change color after brake overheating.ContentsMember CommentsThe O-ring ADThe Brake upgradeLinksMember CommentsMost of the brake issues occur during taxi where the slow forward movement limits rudder authority alone to turn. If you taxi a bit faster, this problem is solved. BUT, you should not taxi with the RPM greater than 1000 on the engine otherwise you are, once again, duplicating the equivalent of stepping on the gas and the brake at the same time. A gentle tap on the brake is usually all that is needed to turn on the ground. I have had close to 700 hours on my plane before I had to replace ANY brake pads. The brakes used o the Cirrus are no different than any other brakes used on any other single engine aircraft. The only unique difference on the Cirrus is: 1) The free castering nosewheel makes it more likely you will get ""lazy"" on the ground and use brake instead of rudder to turn. 2) The unique wheel pants, which allow our planes to fly as fast as they do, allowed too much heat to build up around the tires with continued brake application. This has been remedied with the brake AD.The last brake fire that occurred was found to be mostly caused by excess power application during taxi while applying the brakes. This problem is easily solved by proper technique. The bottom line: If you use your brakes properly and use correct pilot techniques, your brakes and brake pads should last a long time. There is nothing unique about my plane yet the brakes have held up very well. These are no cars brakes and need to be treated with respect. --- As far as takeoff goes, you should NEVER be using the brakes on takeoff;PERIOD! That is the equivalent of putting the brakes on in your car while you are accelerating down the highway. That is the fastest and clearest way to have a brake problem and failure. There is enough forward motion on takeoff that rudder use alone will compensate for any left turning tendency. The 310 HP SR22 engine creates more torque on takeoff but there is enough rudder authority to use them alone to turn right. NO BRAKES PLEASE!! --- Yesterday I removed my main wheel pants so that the local mechanic could install two new Michelon tires. I got almost 700 hours out of the first set but they were pretty worn and more so on one side (of the tire, though evenly side to side) so it was ""time"". While the pants were off I looked at the brake pads (just a good idea). I almost always make taxi turns to the left so I was looking for a left set of pads that were more worn than the rights. While that would make sense the opposite was true and there was a substantial difference (by half)! The only thing I can attribute this to, given my propencity to use the left brake on taxi turns is ""dragging"" the right brake on take offs! Hmmmmm, not a very good technique. Now I am not suggesting that everyone run out and take your pants off at the airport this weekend, especially if you are on a tie down! But I do suggest being aware of dragging that right brake while adjusting for ""P"" factor.Part 43 allows you to change a tire. Removing the wheel pants are a comon process on many planes and I would call it a simple process rater than a complex one. You are not removeing or altering flight control systems. I think you can fly without wheel pants anyway. The onlt trick is must have the AMM and be shown by a A&P how to do it once.As I understand it, you are recommending that we check our brake pads with our pants off. I always FLY with my pants off. However, based on your recommendation I will now follow that sartorial practice for my preflight activities also.'ve looked at quite a large number of Cirrus brake pads; in every case so far, the right pads have been noticeably more worn than the left after a just few hundred hours. I put it down to spriral propwash and torque effects (P factor shouldn't be much of an issue on the ground). Whatever the case, it's pretty normal.I've managed to minimize the effect by making an effort to avoid brakes for steering until I ""run out of rudder"" - it still amazes me how little forward taxi speed I need to be able to affect the direction of the airplane with rudder alone. Also, a long time back, someone on this forum suggested using the ""crowning"" of the taxiways to advantage. Many (most?) taxiways are built so that the centerline is higher than the edges, so that water runs off. By taxiing on on the right side of the centerline, the need for frequent ""right correction"" can be minimized. Have to admit... I often either forget this option, or deliberately ignore it as a point of pride - hate for anyone watching to think that I'm too sloppy to taxi on the centerline!Another ""trick"" is keeping the pilots door open during taxi...although there are only a couple of months a year in northern NH when you can do this.When turning onto the runway for takeoff, I apply power with the nose pointing slightly to the right of centerline. That means that when turning left onto the runway, I stop the turn before it seems quite complete; and when turning right, I overshoot the centerline slightly.This allows for the nose to ""pull"" to the centerline position as you add power, before the rudder begins to be effective. With a little practice, I figured out how much offset to allow so that you need never touch the brakes during takeoff, even at the early stage of the takeoff roll - the time when using brakes seems unavoidable if one starts from a completely ""lined up"" position.I aim to err on the side of too much offset to the right. That way I can allow the airplane to move back to the centerline by simply applying less right rudder.everyone needs to know that EVERY brake ""failure"" on a Cirrus has been the right brake. Considering that the same brakes are installed on BOTH sides, what does that tell you?my brakes have 700 hours on them. I have no clue as to what is ""normal"", never a heat problem (I have the AD stickers), I usually make the early turn offs, so I don't baby them. I don't usually use brake much during taxi (I don't think) but I thought the assymetrical wear was worth a mention. The technique suggestions have been great. My point was to be aware that ""one"" might be ""overusing"" the right brake unconsiously and to be ""aware"" of your technique and that the waer was opposite of what I expected based on the normal turn pattern I use. Clearly (it appears) the brake fires were caused by a taxi issue where the PIC was ""riding"" the brake perhaps unconciously.My understanding is if you have low brake fluid, the right side pedals will fail first.If the pads are worn in a hundred hours, someone is dragging them. It is so easy to do that sometimes you don't realize it. Don't even poise your foot on the pedal lest you lightly pressurize them.I had new pads a year ago at annual. This annual, with 150 hours (plane has a little over 700) on them, the wear was very little. They will go for 2 or 3 more years of this kind of service.I hear varying reports of brake life. A couple very experienced pilots with excellent braking practices have reported some surprising brake life numbers (like 700 IIRC). For me 400 is about it, but I replace things like that a bit before they NEED it. 100 hours is cause for concern.I got over 700 hours on my original brake pads. In addition to taxiing slightly faster than ""normal"" so I can steer with my heels on the floor, I just tap the brakes to start and end turns instead of dragging them throughout, and, especially, I don't try and make the first possible turnoff upon landing.We did the brake upgrade and are happy. In any case ALWAYS have the shop disassemble, clean and relubricate your brake calipers. They get gunked up, rusty, sticky etc and this is obviously something you don't want to cut corners on when your $300k CASTORING nosewheel airplane is landing!Aside from the poor technique of riding brakes a single hard braking event can cause overheating of the brakes such that the rubber o-ring can be marginally damaged. This will not always manifest itslef as a failure at the time of damage. Murphy's Law says it will happen at the most inopportune time!Many pilots have come out to their parked aircraft to see a puddle of brake fluid under a wheel. They put it away after a flight and a week later they come back and all the fluid has leaked out.Why? Because the brake overheated and the o-ring was damaged in one of several ways. It can occur from a single event or cumulative heat damage over several events. Remember this is only a rubber (buna-n or nitrile?) band about 1/8"" of an inch in dia holding several hundred psi of pressure at hot temps!There is more to brakes than the pads.Your brake calipers get dirty and the slider pins and inner surfaces of the cylinders get minor corrosion. An annual dissembly and cleaning and application of anti-seize as well as fresh brake fluid will allow your expensive brakes to last a lot longer.Also, in the case of a castering nosewheel aircraft like ours, the brakes are a safety of life critical control and should be maintained to the highest level. Losing a brake at anytime is going be an event of some sort.There is NOTHING complicated about bleeding the Cirrus brake system either. It is a very standard Cleveland setup. If your shop is taking a long time then they need to get a brake bleeding pressure system.Here is an inexepnsive (brake bleeding pressure system) that is less than the cost of an hour of shop time.http://www.aircraft-tool.com/shop/detail.aspx?PRODUCT_ID=225DXThe O-ring ADI just reread the AD, and the method of compliance is to either replace the O-ring (if not done at the last annual/100 hour inspection) or replace the brake caliper.Further, there's nothing in the AD that says the O-rings are to be replaced every year/100 hours. I conclude this wording is to make sure the better temperature-resistant O-rings are installed in the entire fleet. HOWEVER, the AD references Table 2 of Revision A6 of the POH. I don't have my POH here, so I don't know what that table says. It's possible that table mandates periodic replacement. Maybe someone with a POH handy can post what are that Table's requirements.The AD also requires cutting the temperature sticker inspection holes, installing the temperature stickers and trimming the wheel fairings so they won't hold fluids.The AD goes on to say that an O-ring must be replaced before further flight anytime its temperature indicator turns black.According to Justin at Cirrus Service Center at AFJ, the annual checklist requires O-ring replacement with every annual unless done in between.This SB which is about to become an AD is born out of the series of brake mishaps over the last 5 years that are all related to heat build up in the brake assemblies. This subsequently causes the ""O"" rings to deform which then makes the seal break down which cuases loss of fluid. If the fluid gets too hot it can ignite and cause a fire. Since a lot of folks get nervous when there is a fire, this is the company and FAA response to the problem. The ""O"" ring is a very cheap part, lesss than $2 and the presumption is that your brakes are being inspected during an annual anyway so it should not add two hours of labor to change the ""O"" rings. Most of the labor time is taking off the wheel pants to get to the brakes. The logic is that repeated cycles of over heating the ""O"" rings will lead to their failure due to deformity. It has been shown that the majority of these brake problems have been due to incorrect use of the brakes. But the FAA and Cirrus have no idea who are using the brakes properly and who or not so this AD applies to all of us.The Brake upgradeWe also upgraded to the larger brakes for reasons of overall increased safety.But it should be understood that the larger brakes will not improve braking power as we would think power is improved, rather they will allow for more kinetic energy to be absorbed before braking power fades, fails, catches fire etc. Many complain that they can't lock up the brakes and therefore think that the Cirrus brakes are insufficient. That is not true. If you actually TRY to lock them up, you can but you will flat spot a tire.The Cirrus brakes are actually designed well because this geometry acts as a poor man's ABS (anti-lock braking system). Once you lock up a tire you lose stopping ability, therefore this mechanical threshold braking geometry is a ""good thing""! However, the larger brakes do allow better braking if the perfect storm of situations arises. The kit includes thicker brake discs for increased heat absorbtion, larger calipers and metallic brake pads.They are a good investment and I think Cirrus has priced them fairly.LinksBrake system overheat indicator Stainless brake lines",04:34:00,Sunday

Stick and rudder,3,Landing a Cirrus (or B-727 or any airplane),https://www.cirruspilots.org/copa/member/sr_aircraft/w/copapedia/landing-a-cirrus-or-b-727-or-any-airplane.aspx,No, Eharrison,2013-08-16,0,"?€?There are two critical points in every flight ?€? the beginning and its end.?€? This statement was made by Alexander Graham Bell in 1906. For the LCA conducting IOE, the end of the aerial flight is the most critical point.The LCA and T & R Manuals provide recommendations for teaching the landing maneuver. The following discussion of techniques is intended to help the LCA in teaching the landing maneuver to the pilot who is having difficulty landing the airplane within the touchdown zone. The techniques apply to landing flaps 30 and 40. The student is instructed that the basic difference between flaps 30 and 40 is pitch attitude and thrust required. The thrust required for flaps 30 versus flaps 40 is easily demonstrated by stabilizing early with Flaps 30, noting thrust required, then going to flaps 40 and noting the increased thrust requirement. Flaps 30 pitch attitude is 1 to 2 degrees nose up on the Attitude Director Indicator (ADI) and flaps 40 pitch attitude is level flight on the ADI when established on an ILS.The starting point for the LCA to teach the landing maneuver begins with the initialrtelephone introduction to the student and learning the pilot?€?s background and flightrexperience in order to develop an appropriate lesson plan. The actual teaching of the rlanding maneuver begins at the airplane during the walkaround and geometry demonstration by using ?€?handees?€? to illustrate takeoff and landing attitudes and danger of tailskid contact, and wing device strikes with certain pitch and bank angles. Some inexperienced pilots may not comprehend the amount of drag created with landing flaps. To emphasize the importance of thrust management and speed control, coordinate with ramp personnel, if possible, lower flaps to 40 degrees and then walk under the wing with the student. This demonstration, more than any discussion, will create an unforgettable image while flying.During the briefing, remind the captain or first officer student that the LCA will back up the controls and thrust levers to remain in the loop and not as an indicator of mistrust of the pilot?€?s skill or competence.The following rules should be emphasized during the landing maneuver briefing:Be stabilized earlyMake corrections earlyDon?€?t fixate on touchdown zoneFlareHands off trimLanguage is the key to effective teaching of the landing maneuver. The LCA must be clear, concise and use the same word each time, and be assured the student understands what terms will be used to describe the following:Flare: (flare, check, pull up, etc.)Thrust management: (add power, reduce power, increase thrust, decrease thrust, etc.)Control Transfer: (?€?I have it?€? [in flight] or ?€?I have it as is?€? [on runway], etc.)Go-Around: (takeoff power, go-around thrust, missed approach, go-around, etc.)Land: (close throttles, power off, thrust levers idle, land, roll on, put it on now, etc.)After the first approach, the LCA?€?s instructor work begins with the evaluation followed by instruction. The LCA will see some or all of the following:Not stabilizedApproach slow, fast, high or lowPoor thrust managementFlare high, late or no flareSkip or bounceFirm landingRecommendations for teaching the landing maneuver include the following:STABILIZATION: Require early configuration with Gear Down and Final Descent Checklist completed 3 to 5 miles from the O/M or FAF.CONFIGURATION: Require Gear Down and Final Descent Checklist completed before requesting flaps 25 in order to comply with ATC speed restrictions.SPEED CONTROL: Require flying target speed with appropriate thrust setTHRUST MANAGEMENT: Require aggressive movement of thrust levers with firm grip on all thrust levers and moving them as only one lever.ALIGNMENT: Require staying on extended centerline on approach and on landing. Use example of driving into a car wash with pilot?€?s (captain?€?s right foot & first officer?€?s left foot) on the extended centerline representing the car?€?s front wheel being guided by the car wash track. In the cockpit the pilot is exposed to runway centerline alignment when the LCA goes outside the airplane to demonstrate the geometry for the nosewheel and main gear while the pilot views the reference points from the pilot seat.AIM POINT: Require 1000 foot target point for approach and touchdown. Helpful exercises include:r-- Place grease pencil plus sign (+) on pilot?€?s windshield when on target profile.r-- Have student increase and decrease thrust levers on stabilized approach to note speed change response and feel of pitch control.r-- Have student pitch nose above and below glide slope when established on anrILS to get the feel of the flare requirement and visual reference of the correctrprofile of approach.Additional discussion items which are helpful during teaching of the landing maneuver include:Rate of descent -- the normal rate of descent during approach is 600 to 800 fpm; greater rate indicates presence of tailwind.Height over threshold on 3 degree glideslope -- 50 feet results in 1000 foot touchdown; 100 foot results in 2000 foot touchdown or 25% more landing distance.Increased air speed ?€? 1% results in 2% increase in stopping distance. Excess airspeed puts the pilot in the position of reducing thrust approaching the threshold unspooled and/or being hot and long during the flare. If speed is excessive, it is best to fly the airplane onto the runway near the 1000 foot touchdown point as possible because deacceleration is three times greater on the runway than in the air.Duckunder ?€? sometime caused by illustions and results in 4 to 6 knot increase in airspeed and 400 feet or more increase in descent rate. Inexperienced pilots usually do not perceive or feel the increased rate of descent so the LCA must tell the pilot when this occurs. The student pilot must understand that a duckunder can result in a short or hard landing due to late flare and excessive sink rate, or if the pilot is fortunate enough to flare in time, the airplane can balloon, float and increase air distance which results in a long landing and stopping problem.Ground effect ?€?starts at one half of the wing span. The B-727 wing span is 108 feet. Induced drag is reduced as the airplane nears the runway. Drag reduction ranges from about 1% at the wing span height to about 48% just prior to touchdown. If the airplane is purposely held off to bleed excess airspeed or to ensue a smooth landing, it remains in the reduced drag environment and floating occurs which results in increased air distance and total landing distance.Flare ?€? must start at about 40 feet or just after crossing the threshold on a normal three degree approach to achieve a zero sink rate at touchdown. Pilot can be assisted in flare execution by including radar altimeter in scan and having LCA or second officer call out 100 and 50 feet on the radar altimeter when appropriate. A good visual reference for the landing touchdown attitude can be illustrated during the takeoff roll by pointing out the attitude which occurs at the initial rotation of unsticking the nose gear.Roll on technique ?€? can be used to minimize floating or to save a landing from a sinker with a power increase. The recommended technique to minimize floating, is to fly the airplane onto the runway. This is done by checking the descent, then as ground effect is entered, relaxing the back pressure moderately to facilitate main gear touchdown. After main gear is on the ground, lower the nose gently to the runway. This roll on technique permits early activation of drag devices and more effective stopping because speed is dissipated about three times faster on the ground than in the air. Holding the nose wheel in the air during the landing roll is not acceptable since it increases the stopping distance, the exposure to tail skid strikes and flap or wing tip damage.Shallow skip ?€? keep wings level, avoid assuming a nose up angle of attack, hold attitude and fly airplane onto runway. If the airplane should bounce, hold or reestablish a normal attitude, add thrust as necessary to control the rate of descent and fly the airplane onto the runway.High bounce (or ballooning) ?€? usually result of unstable approach or late or no flare. When a high, hard bounce occurs, initiate a go-around. A second touchdown may occur during the go-around so do not retract the landing gear until a positive rate of climb is established.Reverse ?€? eliminates forward thrust and produces a deceleration force. Reverse must be applied early to be the most effective. After main gear touchdown, apply idle reverse; after nose gear touchdown, apply reverse up to 1.8 EPR (1.75 wet). The reduction of reverse thrust should start at 80 knots and continue smoothly, reaching idle reverse by 50 knots, but the student must be reminded to not get out of reverse routinely near the end of the runway with excessive speed because reverse may keep the airplane on the runway if brakes are not effective.By presenting valuable landing techniques in addition to landing SOP, the LCA can provide students the benefit of what may take years of experience to learn.",18:53:00,Friday

Stick and rudder,3,Why Cirrus aircraft is not suitable for aerobatics?,https://www.cirruspilots.org/copa/member/sr_aircraft/w/copapedia/246.why-cirrus-aircraft-is-not-suitable-for-aerobatics.aspx,No, Roger Whittier,2014-05-11,0,"""I can speak only for myself, of course. I am an active aerobatic competitor, instructor, and judge. I have a Pitts S-2B and fly an Extras, Super Decathlons, Eagles, and other such airplanes for work.You are correct in stating that you wouldn't want to do aerobatics in an airplane not approved or set up for it. I won't touch on the regulations, because I think we are all familiar with those. I'm just talking about practical considerations.Non-acro planes tend to have non-symmetrical airfoils which were not designed to fly aerobatics. They tend to have slower roll rates, lower structural integrity under high G loads, less control authority, etc. The control surfaces are of particular concern. You might have noticed that the control surfaces on aerobatic airplanes are pretty large -- they are designed that way because they're needed to get safely into and out of aerobatic maneuvers.That's not to say an airplane with small control surfaces like a Cirrus cannot perform aerobatics without disaster striking. Duane Cole flew a Bonanza. Bob Hoover used a Shrike Commander. Sean Tucker flies acro in a Columbia.However, the margins are lower, the aerobatics are far more difficult, and pilots not experienced enough and prepared enough for those things are much more likely to end up hurt or dead. Sean Tucker will tell you that the Columbia may not recover from spins of more than one or 2 turns. Duane Cole said the Bonanza (in which he did inverted ribbon cuts) had barely enough elevator authority for the maneuver, and it required incredible strength to hold the nose up far enough for inverted level flight. Bob Hoover tailored his performance to maneuvers the Shrike could do -- he'll tell you he avoided many aerobatic maneuvers because of the airplane's limitations. Knowing those limitations and how to deal with them -- that's where being an experienced professional aerobatic pilot makes the difference. And I'm sure none of those guys took flying those GA airplanes upside down lightly. A lot of planning and consideration, training and practice went into their performances.Now, consider the aircraft condition. Any negative Gs and stuff will be flying around the cabin. Dirt from the carpet. Manuals. Items from the cargo area. Floor mats. Anything in the armrest compartment. That could be a little distracting. Items could get lodged behind the rudder pedals, hit you in the head, etc.If the belts aren't tight enough, you'll go flying around the cabin yourself.The engine is not set up for fuel and oil flow under negative Gs.During aerobatics, the G loads move the entire engine/prop on the engine mount. In the Decathlon you can always see the spinner move up an inch or two when pushing a few negative Gs. Who knows what that would do with the tighter clearances between the spinner and cowl on the Cirrus.Consider trim. The Cirrus flies around with an all-electric trim system which doesn't move all that quickly. The aircraft are typically trimmed for upright flight. That trim setting works heavily against you when inverted.I could go on, but suffice it to say that the more I learn about aerobatics, the less I would want to do them in a non-aerobatic aircraft. Sure, if performed perfectly, you might be just fine. But any unusual attitude is going to be far more difficult -- if not outright impossible -- to recover from.[Media:http://aerobaticman.tripod.com/sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderpictures/decat2.gif]""",03:04:00,Sunday

Weather,3,Icing discussion,https://www.cirruspilots.org/copa/member/sr_aircraft/w/copapedia/312.icing-discussion.aspx,No, Roger Whittier,2014-05-08,0,"""With the recent spate of accidents due to icing, I thought it was worth revisiting the subject of how to make intelligent go/no go decisions.I had an Angel Flight scheduled for this morning, from northern Vermont to eastern Long Island, then returning to White Plains, NY.I started my flight review two days ago, at which time the forecasters were already calling for snow today. I checked each locality on www.weather.com, and found that only New York City was slated to actually get snow. I then looked at the Skew-T plots (my favorite site is Plymouth State Weather Center, available through the COPA weather page) for three locations: KBTV (Burlington, VT), KHTO (East Hampton, NY), and KHPN (White Plains, NY) for a variety of time slots on Thursday. These showed no significant weather all the way through the 48 hour forecast, so I kept my fingers crossed that I could complete the mission and still return to NYC before the snow storm arrived.By yesterday morning, the picture had changed: although the Skew-T plots continued to show no significant weather in Vermont or eastern Long Island, the NY City area was now showing a ?€?wall of icing?€? (discussed below) starting after 1 pm and continuing through the night. Which meant that I would be cutting it very close to the wire if I began the mission at 8 am and hoped to return back to New York City (around noon) before the storm. Based on that data, I saw a 50/50 chance that I would be stuck on eastern Long Island for the duration of the storm, with lots of time to contemplate why I had chosen to begin a three-legged mission that could not be realistically finished.I don?€?t care for 50/50 odds when flying, so I decided to cancel the Angel Flight mission. I also considered the fact that it was unlikely that the pilot with the other half of the mission was going to be able to fly in that weather, so there was no point in leaving the patient stranded far from home. Instead, I decided to go flying locally, to practice instrument approaches with an instructor.Later that day, as the TAFs were revised, it was clear that the arrival time of the storm was moving up: rather than 1 pm, HPN was calling for light snow by 10 am. Based on that information, I scrapped the training flight as well.This morning, I went back to look at how accurate the forecasts were. Its just after 10 am as I write this, and it is definitely snowing outside; and the TAFs for the various locations confirm the data in the Skew-Ts from one and two days ago (KISP is Islip, roughly 50 miles west of East Hampton and the nearest locale with a TAF):This is the AOPA video on Icing which will streamhttp://media.americanflyers.net/firc/icingvideo.wmvBurlington weather is still VFR, with no snow activity until late tonight:KBTV 021134Z 021212 18008KT P6SM SCT050 SCT250     TEMPO 1214 BKN050     FM1700 VRB03KT P6SM SCT045 BKN250     FM2100 36008KT P6SM OVC040     TEMPO 0206 1SM -SHSN BR BKN020     FM0600 34015G22KT P6SM BKN040White Plains weather is snow, snow, snow: all day and into the night.

If they get real close to each other (or meet up), there will be clouds. If that intersection occurs to the left of the pale green, rightward-tilting line emanating from zero on the bottom scale, then its indicative of clouds with high likelihood of icing (unless its to the left of the ?€?20 Celsius line). Altitude is shown in meters in the black letters on the left (millibars are to the far left, for those who want to correlate this data with the relative humidity products at various altitudes).ContentsFirst, the Burlington, VT Skew-T at 7 am this morning:Next is the 10 am Skew-T for East Hampton:And now for White Plains Skew-T:Wing's leading edge after encounter with iceFirst, the Burlington, VT Skew-T at 7 am this morning:This plot shows a chance of clouds at 1,773 meters (not coincidentally, very similar to the scattered clouds at 5,000 feet shown in the TAF above). But at all other altitudes there are is no visible precipitation.Next is the 10 am Skew-T for East Hampton:From 1,367 meters to 4,04 meters (roughly 4,000 to 7,000 feet) the dew point and temperature lines intersect, and that range is to the left of the zero degree Celsius base plot: so one should expect 3,000 feet of icing conditions. Pretty much just at the margin of ?€?safe?€? (but not legal) flight in an SR22 with TKS.Below 1,367 meters, the East Hampton plot is showing no clouds. So in theory there would not be a problem doing this approach once the plane was beneath the clouds (and certain icing). Note, however, that the METAR above tells a different story as to actual conditions: 500 foot overcast ceiling, which is below minimus. So the bad weather ended up moved in faster than the Skew-T model had predicted three hours ago.And now for White Plains Skew-T:Ugly is the only word to describe this. The overlapping red and dotted black lines indicates solid icing from 480 meters (1,200 feet) to 4,101 meters (over 12,000 feet). There is no way that this condition is even remotely ?€?safe?€? for an SR22. It is literally a wall of icing that is best appreciated from the warmth of one?€?s home or in a turbine engine aircraft with two pilots who do this sort of flying for a living.Wing's leading edge after encounter with iceIn sum, there is a wealth of weather products available online (and very easily through the COPA weather links page). IMHO, the Skew-T plots can provide the incredibly valuable information on where and when to expect clouds and icing in the winter.Refferences:From a COPA forum post on 3/2/2006 by Ilan Reich""",22:22:00,Thursday
Weather,3,Inflight ice encounter,https://www.cirruspilots.org/copa/member/sr_aircraft/w/copapedia/313.inflight-ice-encounter.aspx,No, Roger Whittier,2014-05-08,0,"""Well, today it was my turn to experience icing in the almost 700 cirrus hours I?€?ve logged in the past 2+ years. I left Teterboro this afternoon on my way back to Charleston in mostly VFR conditions with a scattered layer at 5500. I was given 6k instead of the 8k I filed for. After climbing to 6k and leveling off it was obvious I would be in and out of the scattered layer, but the winds at 6k were at my back, so I figured I would just stay put for a while.I was actually curious to see if any icing would develop (OAT was -3 to -6C), so I was paying careful attention to any IAS changes and any hint of ice. I flew in and out of the scattered layer for more than an hour, 60-70% time being IMC and no sign of ice until I hit the Cape Charles area. I entered a dense layer and didn?€?t think much of it until I looked out the window and saw a thin layer of ice (less than an 1/8 inch) on the leading edge.My IAS up to that point was 151, but when I looked up a mere 10 seconds after seeing the ice my IAS was 140. I immediately turned on TKS MAX setting, and looked out the window for about 30 seconds. My right seater then called my attention in a startled voice to the airspeed, which was now down to 112 kts. After 3-5 seconds of surprise (aka shock); I went WOT and began a climb to get above the deck while notifying ATC of my actions. Careful not to go below 100 knots, we quickly got above the layer. I knew from the entire flight that the tops were always just above, so at least I planned properly. TKS took care of the layer on the leading edge, but the inner and outer edges maintained an 1/8 inch layer for about an hour until temps warmed to 32F. My 151 IAS speed didn?€?t come fully back until then. I filed a PIREP after being prodded by ATC and reflected back on my learning experience.I've done a pretty good share of educating myself on the dangers of icing, and I thought I took to heart the warnings, but nothing compares to actual experience. I am amazed at how fast the performance degradation was, as in about 90 seconds I lost 40kts of IAS. I have an even more profound respect for the limitations of our single engine aircraft, even with TKS. I have to assume our fixed gear aircraft can be more susceptible to ice accumulation as I've read. I never really thought I was in real danger due to the circumstances, but it is the first time since initial training that my level of apprehension was raised to a brief state of fear.Many of us know that this is the time of year where a large percentage of accidents occur. I believe October and November have been historically very bad months for Cirri. While I expect that I?€?ll encounter icing again someday, I won?€?t go looking for it anytime soon, or let?€?s say ?€?NEVER AGAIN?€?.Similar experience myself a few months back. Same conditions as you describe with 3,000' ceiling and surface temps of +8C. Tops were 6,000' at -5C.Clipping in and out of the tops I started to pick up ice.Knowing that I had clear sky only 200' above and above freezing temps below the clouds, light on fuel and solo I hung around a while to learn a bit about how the ice builds, how the TKS will remove accumulated ice and the effects of sublimation, ice remaining on the unprotected surfaces.And I took pictures for youse guys!This picture shows TKS fluid streaming back UNDERNEATH the ice cuff. In other words, the fluid melted only the ice in direct contact with the panel, and once that thin layer wasn't in contact with the panel, the fluid didn't touch the surface of the ice,First off, the ice built quite quickly and the airspeed dropped fast.Second, the TKS did not seem to effectively remove the ice if I continued in the icing conditions. No way will this system allow you to continue into icing conditions for any length of time.Third, even after the TKS cleared the leading edges the unprotected areas stayed iced up until I descended to warmer air. It did not sublimate off in the sunshine.What I took away from this experience is:1. If you ever find ice building on your plane, put on the TKS and immediately go back where there was no ice. Like now. Do not continue to see if it gets better.2. I'm never going to set out on a flight in freezing conditions where I will have to conduct the flight in IMC. I'll fly above and maybe even climb through a KNOWN layer that I know has good ceilings below.3. If you suspect that you may encounter ice, turn on the TKS before you encounter clouds.If we encounter icing the proper response is to immediately exit. If for some reason you choose an exit strategy that keeps you penetrating icing (as both reports here went for a climb), keep the rule of thirds in mind:-Use no more than 1/3 of your available TKS solution in continued penetration -Use the next 1/3 of your TKS to get out to where you came from if the penetration strategy failed -Save the last 1/3 for dire emergencies only.On a G2 full tank, 1/3 is 20 minutes at Normal, 10 minutes at MAX. If your tank isn't full to start, make proportionate reductions.AOPA Icing VideoForum link""",22:17:00,Thursday

Weather,3,Thunderstorms tips,https://www.cirruspilots.org/copa/member/sr_aircraft/w/copapedia/315.thunderstorms-tips.aspx,No, Roger Whittier,2014-05-08,2,"Practical Tips for ThunderstormsWhen winter weather begins to recede, so does the risk of encountering icing during a cross-country flight in Cirrus.But now its time to think about thunderstorms, which is the other bane of every pilot?€?s existence when it comes to significant weather threats. Many COPA Pilots have Stormscope and WxWorx products in their planes, which provide virtually real time information on thunderstorm activity while enroute. But that?€?s only half the picture, because it is not prudent to begin a flight without a comprehensive understanding of what the forecast calls for. The following memo reflects my personal views, based on various experiences and pre-flight planning techniques. Let me incorporate and invoke the usual Radomsky caveats here, since none of this stuff is to be found in, or condoned by, the POH or FARs.Pre-Flight Planning1.Don?€?t take off on a day when there?€?s potential for thunderstorms without a thorough understanding of the geographic area where that activity is located, the altitude ranges in which convective activity might be present, and the expected severity of the convective activity. I start the analysis by looking at a prog chart, such as the AOPA Surface Analysis Chart. It shows the weather fronts and systems over a 12, 24, 36, 48, 72, 96 and 120 hour basis. It also contains easy to read legend keys: thunderstorms, for example, are denoted in red. This gives the big picture view of storm activity that may be encountered enroute.2.Pilots might also find it useful to use the ADDS Flight Path tool, but I find that it loads slowly even with a broadband connection and doesn?€?t show me anything that isn?€?t already available by looking at the other ADDS tools.3.Instead, I look at the ADDS interactive TAFs page for both my departure and destination airport: it will show cloud bases and whether thunderstorm activity (the dreaded ?€?TSRA?€? abbreviation) is forecast. I generally will not cancel a flight just because there is thunderstorm activity in the forecast, but I will carefully examine the weather enroute and plan several alternate airports in case there is a need to change course or go back instead of traversing a storm. Keep in mind that unlike some icing situations, the Cirrus cannot climb above major convective activity. But as a start, a cruising altitude of 10-13,000 feet will put you above alot of less-than-severe thunderstorm activity, and provide decent to excellent visibility (during the day) of what to avoid.4.Enroute weather: I choose a variety of enroute TAF sites and use those identifiers to study the Skew-T analysis for the entire route, looking at various times before, during and after the proposed flight time. This gives me an idea of where the location and potential intensity/probability of the thunderstorm activity might lie5.Skew-T analysis: this is the most important tool which I use for various times both before, during and after the proposed flight time to make a go/no go decision and to choose the optimal cruise altitude. Scott D. often gave tutorials and analysis in his posts, so those of you who don?€?t know anything about this subject might start by searching the archives, or by attending his seminar. Or you can go to the WEATHER PREDICTION EDUCATION website and start with lesson 291.6.For the somewhat initiated, this memo displays a series of sample Skew-Ts with a layman?€?s explanation of how to read them for thunderstorm clues:Let?€?s say that you?€?re thinking of flying from White Plains, NY (KHPN) to Nashville, Tennessee (KBNA) tomorrow morning.So you go to your favorite prog chart and see something like this:It shows a significant area of thunderstorm activity (the red threat) over Mississippi, Alabama and parts of Arkansas and Tennessee, as of the early morning (6:00 am Central time).The next chart in the sequence confirms that this early-morning thunderstorm is no fluke, and will be blanketing the area all day:It shows the storm smack over nearly all of Tennessee as of 6:00 pm, meaning that the storm is going to be lingering around the destination airport virtually all day. The only good news thus far is that its heading east, rather than northeast, so it won?€?t be an issue for the return flight to New York.So next you go to the Plymouth Skew-T homepage. It will show the following:Enter 4-digit ICAO Station ID (e.g. KCON) or Lat,Lon (43.68,-73.88), then select model, type of product, forecast time, latest or previous model run, whether you want lifted parcel temperatures plotted or not, and size of diagram.Type in KHPN in the ID/LatLon box on the left, and select the forecast timeframe from the Time box. Leave the other choices alone.The site will then produce a Skew-T forecast (shown below) at HPN for 15Z (10 am eastern time) on Tuesday, March 22.  The red line is temperature and the dotted black line is dewpoint.  The temperature scale starts on the bottom (in Celsius), with gray lines slanting up to the right.  The altitude scale is to the left, in both millibars and meters (multiply by three for a rough approximation of feet, since a meter is 39 inches).  I?€?d also do a Skew-T plot for 27 and 30 hours, to cover my return flight.The significant graphic element in looking for thunderstorm activity is the yellow line, which represents the theoretical parcel lapse rate (e.g., the change in temperature/stability of a theoretical box of air as it is lifted up through the atmosphere). Go read a textbook on weather if you want a fuller explanation, but for laymen the thing to watch out for is when the yellow line intersects, or is to the right of, the red temperature line. That?€?s not the case in the chart just above, so this is a classic example of a sunny day, withy nary a cloud in the sky (since the dewpoint and temperature lines don?€?t intersect either).But the Skew-T for Memphis, Tennessee (west of our destination on tomorrow?€?s theoretical flight) tells a very different story:You?€?ll immediately notice that there is a significant gap between the red temperature line and the yellow parcel lapse rate line to its right, and it extends from 1,183 meters (roughly 3,000 feet) all the way up to more than 9,142 meters (28,000 feet). So, yes, thunderstorms are forecast for the area at 21Z (4 pm), and up to heights that cannot be climbed over in Cirrus. But to really understand how strong this convective activity might be, and whether it has a strong probability of occurring, consider the seemingly gibberish numbers to the right of the graph: Items like LI, SI, KI, CAPE and its neighbor CINH are stability indices which together answer those questions.LI is the lifted index at 500 millibars (roughly 15,000 feet). In technical terms, its the difference between the actual and parcel temperature at that atltitude. Less than zero means the possibility of thunderstorms, while ?€?4 or below means severe thunderstorms. In this case the lifted index is ?€?7.3, which means serious convective activity will exist (if it actually happens).SI is the same thing as LI, but at 850 millibars (roughly 5,000 feet). More than +3 indicates showers and thunderstorms; zero indicates showers; and ?€?3 or below indicates severe convective activity. In this case the SI is ?€?0.7, which again confirms serious convective activity at this lower altitude (if it actually happens).Incidentally, if both the LI and SI are negative, then the atmosphere from 15,000 feet and down is highly unstable; conversely, if both are positive, then the atmosphere is quite stable. However, if the LI is negative but the SI is positive, then the boundary layer is unstable and some capping exists: so the thunderstorm activity will not be of the towering variety.KI is the K-Index, which is a more sophisticated index than LI or SI because it assesses convective potential by measuring the temperature and dewpoint spreads at both 500 and 850 millibars. It is, in a way, a combination of the LI and SI indicies. KI of 15-25 means small potential for convective activity; 26-39 means moderate potential; while more than 40 means a high chance of convective activity. In this case the KI is 24, which is right on the borderline of real, potential convective activity.CAPE is a very powerful index, because it shows the potential energy for convective activity stored in the atmosphere by measuring the area between the temperature curve (the red line) and the parcel laps rate curve (the yellow line). Essentially, it adds up the LI (lifted index) for all altitudes, not just at 500 millibars. A CAPE value of less than 1,000 means weak convective activity; 1,000 to 2,500 is moderate activity; and greater than 2,500 means strong convective activity. In this case the CAPE is 1,958, which means that tomorrow?€?s convective potential is worthy of a pilot?€?s respect. But at that level, it does not presage strong convective activity.Finally, CINH measures convective inhibition: how likely it is that a thunderstorm will develop. It computes the amount of energy that the lifting mechanism must expend to overcome the cap on unchecked convective activity. Essentially, it tells whether there is enough CAPE to unleash extensive convective activity. CINH of more than 200 means the cap is quite strong, so its highly unlikely that thunderstorms can develop. Between 50 and 15 means that strong lines of clouds will develop; between 15-50 means that some strong thunderstorms are likely; and less than 15 means fair weather cumulus clouds. In this case, CINH is 6, which is not very threatening.The bottom line analysis of the graph above is that thunderstorms are likely, but not towering. So from a decent altitude (10-13,000 feet), it may well be possible to stay above most activity and to veer clear of anything that is particularly tall and threatening.By comparison, look at the Skew-T for Nashville at 18Z (1 pm eastern time), right around the expected arrival time:None of the five key indicies (LI, SI, KI, CAPE and CINH) have interesting values: in particular, there just isn?€?t enough CAPE to light a firecracker. And the graph confirms this at a glance: the yellow line never really crosses to the right of the red line. The only interesting thing to note from this is that the cloud layer will extend virtually from the surface to 15,000 feet or higher, with the freezing level at 2,733 meters (roughly 8,500 feet). So icing is still a consideration, even with thunderstorms not very far away at Memphis.In-Flight Tactics1.I prefer to flip between Stormscope and Traffic Watch on the #2 Garmin, with the Stormscope set at 120 degree view and 50 miles. I also prefer to fly at 10-13,000 feet even if there is a speed penalty due to the wind, because it generally offers a better view of the weather and sometimes even puts me above the system (remember to check the LI, SI and CINH indexes to see if this is feasible).2.When the MFD warns of lightening, I clear all of the details and set it for 200 miles: this provides a large scale view of where the thunderstorm activity is located, and the direction in which it?€?s traveling. Periodically I hit Clear Strikes on the MFD, so that I can see where the storm is moving in relation to my proposed flight path.3.I also watch the Garmin #2 and stay clear of any cells/strikes within 20 miles. I also watch the strike rate in the upper right and corner of the Stormscope display on the Garmin: it shows the number of strikes within the displayed radius (e.g., 25 or 50 miles) within the past minute. ATC is very accommodating on days such as this, permitting deviations of 10-30 degrees as requested.4.More often than not, simply staying the course and flying the original flight path is the best alternative. Remember, a Cirrus is traveling at more than 150 knots, while the storm is moving at 30-50 knots, so its usually possible to outrun a storm, especially if the strike rate is rather low. This is true even when it appears on the MFD (200 mile range) that there is dangerous activity all around.5.At times when it is not possible to find a wide path between the cells and strikes shown on the Stormscope, or when the strike rate within 50 miles goes above 20-40, consider asking ATC for a hold or diverting to an alternate airport until the weather passes.6.Nighttime convective activity is a whole other story, which I won?€?t venture to explore in this memo. The short answer, however, is DON?€?T.",22:10:00,Thursday
Weather,3,XM aviation weather,https://www.cirruspilots.org/copa/member/sr_aircraft/w/copapedia/316.xm-aviation-weather.aspx,No, Roger Whittier,2014-05-09,0,"XM Aviation Weather is a XM satellite download service, costing about $600 per year.XM Aviation Weather can be received by either:an installed panel mount XM weather receiver, orA Garmin 396 or 496 portable GPS/TAWS/XM weather/audio receiverThe XM aviation weather service offers winds aloft, lightning, NEXRAD radar, etc.XM NEXRAD RadarThe downloaded XM NEXRAD Radar display shows precipitation activity as Red, Yellow, or Green.The following posts were made by experienced COPA members about interpeting the XM NEXRAD Radar display.I personally will not fly through anything that is yellow or worse--unless I am below or way above the weather. It is a judgement call that I make depending on the variables like turbulence, OAT, weather movement, hail, lightning, passsengers, convective patterns, etc... When in doubt, don't do it! It is better to be on ground wishing you were in the air! - Thomas HoagI would never ever go into red. Many years ago, before Stormscope and data link Nexrad, I got vectored into what I am sure was red. You get a lot more than really wet. It is not only frightening, it is very dangerous. I never want to experience that again, and I hope no one else has to. I think I recently read something on AOPA that mentioned that 25% of fatal weather related accidents were because of thunderstorm encounters. Avoid it, and with the equipment we now have, there is not much excuse not to stay away from it. - Todd CarollJudgment & experience are your best friends. Sometimes green, or even yellow can be perfectly safe. Sometimes you think it's green, but by time you get there, green turns to red. The stormscope should be read simultaniously with Nxrad to get the best overview. Also, make sure you are operating with the latest Avidyne update. - Dennis HaberAre these rain bands from a tropical system? If yes, I'd stay out of any precip over 40 dBZ (yellow and higher) and I'd try to remain VFR. Tropical systems have a lot of associated shear and produce some interesting tornadic cells that do NOT have any lightning (ground-based or intercloud) and can be extremely dangerous. Are there any other convective cells (that is, with lightning) in the immediate vicinity? If yes, you are in a convectively active environment and I would strongly encourage you to stay clear of yellows, reds and purples (depending on the display you are using purple may be a valid color indicating intense rain or hail) assuming the tops (not echo tops) of the cell is greater than 16,000-18,000 ft (AGL). In these ""taller"" clouds significant updrafts may exist and it is very likely that this cloud is working its way to becoming a cumulonimbus cloud (CB). Even with ""baby"" towering Cu, a strong wind aloft (greater than 30-40 knots) will likely produce some significant (scary) turbulence in the cloud. Stay out of the cloud and you'll stay out of the turbulence. In these cases, there may not be a Nexrad signature at all. ... Lightning is a result of the presence of ice (snow, ice crystals or hail) in the clouds. As mentioned above, some convective cells such as those contained in landfalling tropical systems do not have much in the way of ice, and therefore do not usually exhibit any lightning. Moreover, these cells may not necessarily exhibit intense Nexrad radar echoes (reds). However, these cells often can produce extreme wind shear, funnel clouds, small (F0 or F1) tornadoes and intense winds. Another important consideration for making it through an organized or unorganized convective system is to stay visual. Fly high and remain in VMC and you won't likely experience any serious bumps.-Scott DennstaedtI will fly through yellow as long as its just rain and not convective. Depends what other equipment is telling me. If the stormscope is alive, I give it a wide berth. Yellow can be just heavier rain than the light dribble of rain that looks green and no big deal. Or it can be exciting.- Roger WhittierXM Nexrad is a 'composite' picture of many altitudes blended into one picture. Therefor your actual in flight conditions can vary from the composite picture. Learn to correlate electrical activity and rainfall along with a very thorough preflight briefing. - Ralph Cohennexrad shows you the water and stormscope shows you the turbulence or electrical activity. Between the two you can watch a thunderstorm advance in all of its stages. I have been up on many a summer day where activity starts to show on the stormscope even before any rain appears. You can then watch the whole event unfold as the storm builds. The nexrad image shows more and more moisture and the lightening becomes mor4e and more frequent. when the storm ""burns out"" you see the same process in reverse. The combination of stormscope and nexrad in the cockpit capability is one of the greatest advances for GA flying in the last 50 years. - Brian TurrisiIt's wise to get to know how your XM radar information displays precipitation, whether it is optimistic or pessimistic in your opinion. Flying into yellow or red or purple areas in the display is asking for trouble; however, light and dark green may be more than you are willing to penetrate, especially if you have had experiences of depictions of rain in your area when there was none present.XM Weather Winds AloftWinds aloft are graphically depicted at 3,000 foot intervals and generally agree with reality.XM Weather Lightning DisplayThe downloaded XM Weather Lightning reflects only cloud-ground lightning and is downloaded every 3-9 minutes.

For a new pilot to train in? Is it easy or hard to fly?Cirrus owners love their aircraft. Whether a Cirrus is right for you depends upon what you need from an aircraft. ""Match the aircraft to the mission"" is time-honored adage. Cirrus aircraft are fast and have very advanced avionics. They are better suited to cross-country travel than to putting around the local area, and they are not ideal for rough or short fields.Whether a Cirrus is appropriate for low-time pilots is controversial. Some Cirrus owners have bought a Cirrus as low-time pilots, and many of them are proponents of the approach of learning in the aircraft you will ultimately be flying, and will emerge from the supervised training environment with much Cirrus-specific skill and experience. It?€?s often pointed out that the military trains new pilots in high performance aircraft routinely.Other Cirrus owners feel that the airplane is too advanced to be appropriate for pilots without significant time in more forgiving aircraft. They point out that civilian flight training is far less intensive than military training. Some of the Cirrus accidents happened to relatively low-time pilots, but the extent to which this is objectively a factor is controversial.Some insurance companies are reluctant or unwilling to insure a pilot with less than about 500 hours and an instrument rating, although this varies. It will be more expensive to obtain significant insurance coverage if you are a low-time pilot when it is available.Cirrus aircraft are not difficult to fly, however:they have very advanced avionics that require considerable training and experience to master, andCirri can be flown faster than most light planes, and when they are things happen quicker",00:55:00,Friday

Insurance,3,Insuring your airplane,https://www.cirruspilots.org/copa/member/sr_aircraft/w/copapedia/499.insuring-your-airplane.aspx,No, Roger Whittier,2014-05-09,0,"ContentsCaveat: USA-specific DiscussionWhy Bother?The Aviation Insurance MarketBuying InsuranceDirect WriterBrokerThe Two Types of InsuranceHull InsuranceLiability InsuranceTypes of Liability PoliciesSublimitsSmooth CoverageWho Is Covered?Legal DefenseThe Insurance ApplicationDenial of CoverageHow Much Insurance Should I Buy?What If I Cannot Get Enough Liability Insurance?COPA Insurance DataCaveat: USA-specific DiscussionThis COPApedia article concerns aircraft insurance in the USA. Insurance and general aviation practices in other countries are sufficiently different to require separate treatment.Why Bother?The purpose of insurance is to manage risk. As an aircraft owner you face a risk of damage or destruction to your airplane for any number of reasons. Should you do something with your airplane that results in injury, death or property damage, you may be held financially responsible for such losses. If you are sued, you face the cost of defending yourself, whether or not the legal system finds you liable.If you are wealthy enough that potential financial losses associated with airplane ownership do not worry you, you can do without insurance. If that is not the case, you need aircraft insurance.Before going any further it is appropriate to point out that neither owning your airplane through a corporation or LLC, nor forming a professional corporation with you as an employee, nor putting into practice any other sure-fire lawsuit-avoidance ideas you may hear from your pilot buddies help protect you from a possible lawsuit if you fly the plane into an accident. Such dodges have been tried for years, largely unsuccessfully.Now, if two or more pilots share ownership in an airplane, having a US corporation or LLC own the plane may be helpful in some situations. Suppose you own your airplane in an LLC or corporation with other pilots. If one of your partners or fellow shareholders has an accident that leads to liability, your personal liability may be capped by your investment in the entity: typically the cost of the airplane. Such arrangements can be complicated, varying from state to state. If you are a part-owner, it may be worth your time and money to seek the advice of an attorney familiar with the nuances of joint airplane ownership.The reality is that there are certain steps to take when faced with a risk: First do what you can be done to reduce the risk. In aviation that means taking regular recurrent training and making decisions with regard to the type of flying you do and whether you will carry passengers and, if so, who and how many. And then, once the risk is as low as possible, either decide it is still too great and that you are not willing to fly, or purchase insurance.The next step is to treat insurance as a consumer good and make sure that it fits your circumstances and needs.Insurance is a contract that you enter into; you and the insurer are bound by the terms of the contract and you each have obligations should certain events occur. Therefore, it is utterly essential that you take the time to read the insurance policy as soon as you get it.The Aviation Insurance MarketThe aircraft insurance market is small, risky and expensive. The 200,000-odd US general aviation fleet represents a pitifully small market for any insurance company to consider entering. Aircraft flown by amateur pilots have a high accident rate, making the market even less attractive. Finally, general aviation attracts a well-to-do demographic, so injury and death usually lead to higher awarded damages than the typical automobile accident.There are roughly a half dozen companies that are willing to write insurance on aircraft. Of those, none write for all types of aircraft. So you have limited choices when it comes to selecting an insurer. The underwriters at each insurance company identify and price insurable risk. Each company uniquely interprets actuarial data to make its underwriting decisions, which is the primary reason that insurance quotes from different companies vary so dramatically.Buying InsuranceThere are two ways to buy insurance for your airplane: through a broker or directly from the insurance company.Direct WriterThere is currently only one company, Avemco, that is a ""direct writer"" of GA insurance. In other words, Avemco is the only company you can call up and buy insurance from without going through an intermediary. You call Avemco and speak with an individual who takes the information regarding your airplane and you as a pilot, you then receive a quote for hull and liability coverage and you can ""bind"" the policy right then and there, that is, make it effective immediately. The only thing to keep in mind is that the person you are speaking to on the telephone is an employee of the insurance company and owes no fiduciary responsibility to you, only to the company.BrokerThe more common way to purchase insurance is to contact an aviation insurance broker. A broker owes his or her fiduciary responsibility to you, not to an insurance company, and functions as your agent. S/he takes down details on your airplane and your piloting experience and then goes into the market and shops coverage for you. It is a good idea to be prepared when you speak to the broker as you should give him or her as much ammunition as possible to make you a very attractive risk to the market. Different insurers use different techniques for rating risk, so if you are taking recurrent training every six months, tell your broker because that may make a difference with one or more of the insurers, resulting in a lower price for your insurance.Most brokers represent that they shop all of the aviation insurers. That is not necessarily the truth, so it pays to ask the broker to name the insurers they work with.Insurers keep track of your airplane's N number; so if you don't like what your broker told you and you go to another, the second broker will not be able to get a quote from the insurers; they have already given a quote. The only way to get another quote is to give the second broker a letter stating that you have pulled your business from the first one. Even then, an insurer may refuse to re-quote, or to lower the price.The Two Types of InsuranceWhen you purchase insurance you will be quoted a price (premium) for coverage for damage or destruction of the airplane itself (hull insurance - aviation insurance evolved from admiralty insurance) and for coverage for damage or injury you may cause to others or their property (liability insurance).Hull InsuranceHull insurance pays to repair your airplane if it is unintentionally damaged. (Other typical exceptions include war or terrorism, so be sure to read the policy).When you arrange your hull insurance, you and your insurer agree on a value for your airplane. It is normally what it would bring on the market in its current condition, current time on the airframe and current avionics. If your valuation is higher than the Blue Book or Vref value, you will need to explain, for instance, by providing data on special avionics or mods to the airplane. Otherwise you will be limited to an insurance limit not much over Blue Book or Vref.An airplane's value usually changes over time, so check it and adjust as necessary at renewal time.There will be a deductible, which, depending on the company and the amount of the deductible, may affect the price of the insurance.Hull insurance pays for repairs following unintentional damage. However, it does not pay for repairs to a part that fails, only to other parts that are damaged as a result of the initial failure. If a connecting rod in the engine breaks and then trashes the inside of the engine, causing it to fail and leading to a forced landing, your insurance will pay for repairs to everything but the connecting rod itself, minus the amount of the deductible. It will pay to repair the engine, not overhaul it, as that is ""betterment"". You are entitled to have the engine returned to the condition it was in before the connecting rod let go, which means a repair. It will pay to repair the airplane as well. If you manage to land without any damage to the airplane, the insurance will still pay to repair the engine. Nevertheless, you must read the policy to determine precisely what is covered. The policies are not identical between companies.If your airplane is damaged and cannot be repaired for less than the agreed upon value for the airplane (or, in some cases, for less than 75% of the agreed upon value of the airplane - read your policy) the insurance company has the right to consider the airplane ""totaled"" and simply pay you the agreed-upon value of the airplane as per the policy. If the company offers to pay and you accept the money for the agreed value of the airplane, you will be required to sign a Bill of Sale for the airplane and turn it over to the insurance company. It will probably try to sell the wreckage to someone who wants to rebuild it, or to a salvage yard so as to get something back after it has paid out on your policy. Yes, you often can bid on the wreckage if you are so inclined.If you wish to insure your airplane for a lower than market value, your insurer will likely be agreeable. But while that will reduce your hull insurance premium, it carries a serious risk: If the airplane is damaged, but not badly, and repair estimates approach the agreed upon value, the insurer can consider the airplane totaled. You then are faced with a decision: You entered into a contract - all insurance is governed by contract law - and you agreed with the insurance company on a low value for your airplane. You can either sign over the airplane to the insurance company and get a check for that amount, or you can say that you don't want to take the money. If you chose not to take the money, you are on the hook for the cost of repairs; the insurance company offered to live up to its end of the contract and you declined, the insurance company's obligation is over. Yes, there have been owners faced with such a situation and who could not afford to fix their airplane on their own and had to turn over an airplane that could be fixed to the insurance company for less than it was actually worth!Liability InsuranceLiability insurance covers you for injury, death or property-related loss, up to the stated amount of the policy. It also pays for the cost of defending you if you are sued. That is crucially important because the cost of defending a lawsuit may be greater than any damages owed, especially if the court absolves you of blame.Types of Liability PoliciesAn aviation liability policy will have a ""limit"". That is the maximum amount that the company will pay for damage you cause. The standard aviation policy has a $1 million overall limit.SublimitsRead your policy carefully, because the most popular aviation policies contain what are known as ""sublimits"". A sublimit is the maximum paid to any one person or passenger. Such policies are popular because they make a lot of money for the insurers. Pilot/owners have learned to their dismay that they did not have the insurance they thought they did. The most popular million dollar policies have $100,000 sublimits, meaning that if you crash with two passengers who are injured or killed, there is only a total of $200,000 to pay any claims by those passengers ($100,000 each). That is unlikely to be enough coverage for anyone who has the financial wherewithal to own a Cirrus. If the pilot is found to be negligent, a passenger who suffered a broken leg could well be awarded more than $100,000 by a jury. In case of death due to pilot negligence, $100,000 is usually not even close to covering a likely jury award.From time to time there are policies that have extremely low sublimits for injury to family members, reasoning that they are less likely to sue the pilot after an accident. Sometimes that reasoning is accurate, sometimes it is not, to the eventual financial despair of the pilot.Smooth CoverageA policy that does not have sublimits is called a ""smooth"" policy. In the accident described above, with two injured passengers, there is a total of one million dollars available to split between the two. Historically, such amounts are enough to resolve most lawsuits unless the pilot is quite wealthy.A smooth policy is more expensive to buy than one with sublimits and may not be available to low time pilots, those with low time in type, or without an instrument rating.Who Is Covered?Generally, the ""named insured"", the owner of the policy, is covered by the policy. Additional persons or entities may be added to the policy as named insureds, so that they are covered by the policy as well. In such a scenario, they are provided a defense if sued and the money available to pay damages caused by them is available to them. Often a hangar rental agreement will require that the airport or city that owns the airport be added to the aircraft policy as a named insured. If you have an instructor who often flies with you, it's wise to add him or her to the policy as a named insured.If you allow another pilot to fly your airplane, you are covered if that pilot meets the ""open pilot warranty"" in the policy. That is, the pilot must hold the ratings and have the flying time required in the policy. If that pilot has an accident, then you are covered for the loss and the insurance company will pay for the repairs and defend you should you be sued. That pilot is not covered by the policy. Meeting the open pilot warranty means that you are covered, not that pilot. To ensure coverage, s/he must be added to the policy as a named insured. It has happened that an insurance company has subrogated against a pilot who wrecked an airplane when that pilot met the open pilot warranty requirements and the insurance company paid out to the owner for repairs. That is legitimate under the insurance contract.If you allow a pilot who does not have the ratings or flight time required in the open pilot warranty to fly the airplane, you are not covered if that pilot has an accident.Legal DefenseYour policy will include coverage to defend named insureds against a law suit. The cost to defend you is not included in the dollar limits. While you are the defendant, the insurance company has the right to settle the case. They must also defend you for claims exceeding the limits of the policy although they will only pay an award per the limits of your policy. It is not uncommon for a damage award to be less than the legal bills.The Insurance ApplicationAt some point in the process of obtaining insurance, you will be required to fill out an application that asks you a number of questions about your history. Do not lie! Do not inflate your flying time, by even one hour. Insurance contracts fall under state law, so the effect of padding your flight time on the application varies by state. But keep in mind that in some states padding your flight time by even one hour is grounds for the insurer to deny coverage.Denial of CoverageIt happens. Something bad happens involving your plane and your insurance company informs you it is denying coverage. Of course, you have the right to challenge that denial, and in some states you are entitled to recover incurred expenses plus a penalty against the insurance company for a wrongful denial.As mentioned above, your insurance coverage might be denied because you lied on your application. But there are other reasons. Most policies have language stating that coverage is effective when the plane is airworthy. As an example, an airplane that is ""out of annual"" is not considered to be FAA airworthy.Case study: Pilot Bob buys a used plane that is due its annual in three months. Immediately after the purchase Bob takes the plane to his favorite A&P and asks him to give it a good look over and to fix whatever is wrong. Bob's A&P notes the annual is not due for three months. He gives it a good look over and fixes what he finds. Bob picks it up and assumes it has a new annual. Bob's A&P, however, did not do a full-blown annual and does not include an annual inspection sign off in the log books.Bob does not look at the log books when he picks up the plane. He flies off thinking all is well and he has twelve months before another annual inspection. Four months later Bob buys some contaminated fuel. The contamination leads to an off airport landing. Bob is fine, but the plane is totaled.After investigation, Bob's insurance company, noting the plane was not airworthy because it was one month out of annual, denies coverage. But the annual or lack thereof had nothing to do with what caused the damage and an annual the day before the fuel purchase would have changed nothing.Who wins in such denial of coverage cases? It depends your state.Some states say the cause of the damage must be related to the policy provision that was not met. Others states say there does not have to be a relationship to what caused the damage and the policy provision that was not met. Unfortunately, most states side with the insurance companies on this one.Also, as noted above, be sure and check your ""open pilot clause"" or ""open pilot warranty."" That is the policy clause defining the qualifications other pilots must have to fly your plane while keeping your coverage active. Some insurance companies, particularly when insuring a Cirrus, are less than clear about this. The policy may have an open pilot clause that looks fairly liberal in terms of qualifications, but read further and you find another endorsement or clause that says, in effect: ""Just kidding about that other open pilot clause stuff. We only insure your plane when you, and we mean you, are PIC.""How Much Insurance Should I Buy?That is a discussion to have with your personal attorney. The usual aviation liability policy is for $1 million in liability coverage. For a person who can afford a Cirrus, it is worth considering trying to get more coverage, perhaps two million dollars. Depending on your experience level and ratings, and the condition of the insurance market, you may or may not be able to reasonably buy what you need.Be careful about the valuation of your aircraft for the hull coverage. There are risks both to over- and under-insuring. The under-insuring risk is apparent; you may not get enough money to replace your loss. But over-insuring also has a risk; if you over-insure your aircraft, then the insurance company may insist on repairing damage which would more sensibly suggest a total loss and replacement.What If I Cannot Get Enough Liability Insurance?It is not uncommon to find oneself with insufficient liability insurance, either due to absurdly low sublimits or a low overall limit. In that case you may decide to not carry passengers at all, or to only carry selected passengers. Or, you may hire a pilot to fly your airplane; professionally-flown airplanes are more insurable. There are even examples of pilots who gave up flying because their risk profile couldn't be adequately covered by available insurance.COPA Insurance DataMany COPA members voluntarily share their insurance rate and insurer information.

Insurance,3,Named insured,https://www.cirruspilots.org/copa/member/sr_aircraft/w/copapedia/500.named-insured.aspx,No, Roger Whittier,2014-05-09,0,"""Named InsuredThe Named Insured - usually the registered owner of the aircraft, because that is what the policy is covering / protecting. If the named insured is a Corp or LLC, then the wording usually states the offices, directors, etc in a corp have the liab protection also or members of the LLC. However, be certain of this; it may be necessary to name the corporations's stockholders/officers who are flying the airplane or the L.L.C. members who are flying the airplane.Named PilotA Named pilot is one who has been approved by the underwriter on an individual basis and may or may not meet an open pilot warranty. Typically the policy premium is based on the lowest rated or least experience. The named insured is covered by the policy when the airplane is being flown by a named pilot, however, that named pilot may or may not be covered by the insurance policy, check the policy language.Open Pilot WarrantyThe Open Pilot Warranty is the provision in the policy to protect the insured if someone other than the named insured operates the airplane. It must be made clear that the open pilot warranty protects the named insured(s) only, it does NOT protect the pilot flying the airplane under the open pilot warranty. Warning: A PILOT OPERATING AN AIRPLANE UNDER THE OPEN PILOT WARRANTY IS NOT AN INSURED UNDER THE POLICY; HE OR SHE IS NOT INSURED AGAINST ANY LIABILITY CLAIMS MADE AS THE RESULT OF A CRASH WHEN HE OR SHE IS FLYING THE AIRPLANE. If a pilot meeting the open pilot warranty requirements has an accident with the airplane, the insured is covered; that is, the insurance company will pay for repairs and defend the named insured(s) against liability claims. If the pilot operating the airplane does not meet the open pilot warranty requirements of the policy and has an accident, the named insured is not covered. The insurance company will not pay for repairs to the aircraft nor will it defend the named insured(s) against liability claims.Because a pilot operating an aircraft under the open pilot warranty of a policy is not an insured, that is - is not covered by the policy itself, if he or she has an accident and damages the airplane it is likely that the insurer will seek to recover the money it paid out to repair the airplane from that pilot. While this action, called subrogation, was fairly uncommon in the past, it has become increasingly so since 2005. It therefore behooves a person using another's airplane under the open pilot warranty to either become a named insured under the policy, if possible, or obtain a waiver of subrogation from the insurance company (if possible) or carry renter's insurance.""",00:50:00,Friday

As was stated (not quite in this way) in an earlier post in this thread, if you're the owner and the only pilot, having an LLC/corporation isn't normally useful as you can be named in a lawsuit personally because you're the pilot operating the plane (plus you have to depreciate the airplane which may not be financially beneficial when you sell it). If you own the airplane with others, you are insulated from liability if one of the other pilots has an accident.If own the aircraft with others, as partners, the individual partners are not insulated against liability should one of them crash the airplane. It is not unusal for all of the partners who own an airplane to be sued if one of the partners crashes the airplane.If you use your plane for business, I'd recommend adding that businesses name as an additional insured on the policy.If you are an individual (or married couple) that own a plane, putting it in an LLC or corporation doesn't provide as much of a liability shield because the pilot would normally also be sued.

Purchasing,3,Typical ownership costs,https://www.cirruspilots.org/copa/member/sr_aircraft/w/copapedia/typical-ownership-costs.aspx,No, Eharrison,2013-08-17,0,"The cost of owning a Cirrus is often debated on the forums.  How much it costs depends upon what costs you want to include.  The discussion tends to get heated when the cost of capital and cost of depreciation are added in, and these are often the largest costs involved.Example: for an SR22 2005 GTS purchased new costs include:  ~2520/mo for the aircraft, 3500/yr hangar, 250hr IFR rated pilot 8000/yr for insurance and then the extras: powertow 1100, charts/garmin card updates annually 1100, gadgets (296, oregon aero seat, aircraft shades) ~1000, and finally maintenance (Tailwind package included 6 oil changes ""free"") which has been probably $5k over the past several years inclusive of annuals and exclusive of covered warranty items.   Then there is oil and gas, but those are variable costs.   Depreciation for 100% business use (perhaps a more viable number to use is 80%) is around 120,000 per year or so as best I can recall.

Taxes,3,Tax benefits of a busness airplane,https://www.cirruspilots.org/copa/member/sr_aircraft/w/copapedia/513.tax-benefits-of-a-busness-airplane.aspx,No, Roger Whittier,2014-05-08,0,"It?€?s nearly impossible to get quick answers when it comes to aviation tax questions. Everybody seems to be afraid of providing ?€?generic?€? tax information since it might not apply in all cases. So I?€?ll try to share what I?€?ve found. Keep in mind, I?€?m not a tax expert, so use this information with a grain of salt (and consult an aviation tax expert):If you plan to use your airplane mostly for business (> 50%), you can buy it in a wholly owned subsidiary for your business to maximize tax benefits. This new business would essentially be in the business of ?€?renting?€? its only aircraft to you or your business.Once you have the airplane under the business, each hour the plane is used must be ?€?rented?€? from your new entity. Generally, the rental is either by your business (for business use) or by you (for personal use). Your aviation tax expert can prepare the rental agreements and rates for you. In this arrangement, your new business would have a small amount of revenue.While airplanes are frequently financed on 20-year terms, they can be depreciated on a 5-year schedule and each depreciation dollar would essentially be an expense of this new entity. Additionally, the finance charges of the loan as well as maintenance costs of the plane are all expenses to the business entity.The expected outcome is that the new entity would have a substantial operating loss (mostly due to depreciation in the first 5 years). Since these losses would negatively impact your income, you wouldn?€?t pay income taxes on the depreciation of the aircraft and other expenses (although you do pay taxes on the rental revenue, which is substantially less). Depending on your tax bracket and income, you could save X% of the purchase price of the airplane in a 5-year period, where X = [Your Top Tax Rate]. In some cases, this could be as high as 40%! That?€?s pretty incredible savings. In fact, if you finance your plane on a 20-year loan, and you are in the 40% tax bracket, it?€?s possible to be upside down in the first 5 years (meaning you save enough money on taxes to make all the payments and then some). After 5 years though, you?€?re on your own, so plan ahead for the following 15 years too. Nobody said this was going to be cheap! Also, keep in mind that if you don?€?t make more money than the depreciation expense of your plane, your tax benefit will be limited.Section 179 depreciation guides for small businesses with less than $500,000 in assets also allow for even faster depreciation of the plane. Up to an additional $125,000 of depreciation, although this is combined with any other assets the company has. Also, this depreciation expense starts to go away after a business has $500,000 in combined assets, making the purchase price of an airplane relatively important if you want to take advantage of this additional benefit.There are State-Specific Aviation tax guidelines that can greatly impact your purchase. I don?€?t know any of them, so do your own research.There is a significant tax benefit of owning a plane for business. The savings are driving more and more businesses to own aircrafts. It was the final straw to convince me to go ahead and make the plunge for my business.One additional tax issue to consider is the timing of your purchase. If you purchase an aircraft prior to September 30th of a given year, the depreciation schedule is more favorable than if you make your purchase after September 30th. It?€?s something along the lines of 20% instead of 5%. Although that?€?s partially offset by the depreciation in subsequent years for those who purchase after September 30th, so keep the September 30th time in mind when making a purchase.A great source of information and a potential tax advisor is a company called Aviation Tax Consultants.Original web post]This article is added by persmission from Hamid Shojaee",02:36:00,Thursday

Accident history and statistics,3,Airspace as a contributing cause of accidents,https://www.cirruspilots.org/copa/member/sr_aircraft/w/copapedia/airspace-as-a-contributing-cause-of-accidents.aspx,No, Eharrison,2013-08-16,0,"The tragedy of NY crash of SR20 is that this very likely was a result of a mortal fear of flying into the Class B. I think it was a ""holy crap - we have to turn around or else we'll bust the Class B!!"" event. If so, here is my take on that.This is partially a consequence of the almost hysterical fear that is being driven into us since 9/11 about airspace. It is common knowledge that if you so much as nick a TFR, even as a first-time offense in a lifetime of safe flying, you are going to get a suspension, perhaps even a revocation (depending on the airspace, e.g. presidential TFR), and otherwise reamed. The severity of the penalties for TFR busts have almost certainly filtered down into Class B busts or any airspace violation. I believe that this fear directly contributed to the accident.And what is it that they feared? Flying into air! Would anyone's safety actually have been compromised if they had nicked the Class B by a half a mile? No. But the fear was so great that they likely executed an unsafe turn to avoid it.I think that this situation is analogous to a similar out-of-scale regulatory / enforcement situation that the FAA previously promoted and later abandoned because it was killing people. That situation started in the 50's and 60's when there would be a lot of ""paperwork"" and grilling if you declared an emergency. This created a fear of declaring, and they finally realized that pilots had become so afraid of declaring that they were killing themselves rather than taking advantage of ATC assistance. The best example of this was the Avianca 707 accident (ironically in New York) where they ran out of fuel and crashed rather than let on to ATC that they were sucking fumes. This of course resulted in the ""minimum fuel"" call, but this also marked the beginning of the end of the FAA's ""penalties"" for declaring. It has taken 30 years for them to try to dispel the fear of declaring that they had so firmly planted in pilots and CFI's. There are still accidents where pilots don't get the help that they should solely because of an artificial fear of something that will not hurt them.Now fast forward to post-9/11. Now the big deal is airspace busts. We're all trembling in our boots that we don't accidentally dip a wing into some unseen yet completely safe sliver of air. The FAA has made it clear that if you do so you will be severely punished. Now look at this accident in this light. To me, this accident is the Avianca Flight 52 bellwether of the consequences of the highly-complex, fear-driven airspace environment and the FAA's (and TSA's) viscous enforcement policy.And for what purpose? There have been over 5,000 intercepts of GA airplanes since 9/11. Do you know how many of these represented actual security or terrorist threats? Of course you do. ZERO! NONE of them! You can drive your Ryder truck all you want within P56, but if you are in a flyspeck GA airplane you are likely going to have to have specific training about the Washington airspace if you dare venture within 100 miles!Here's the ultimate irony: I'm betting that the river sightseeing routes adjacent to Manhattan are history, and will soon be restricted by, of course, yet more restricted airspace! So this new restricted airspace will be as a direct result of someone desperately trying to avoid other restricted airspace. Can you just see this marching across the whole dang country? This is happening. That whole new NPRM proposing the 100nm ""ADIZ training"" area around Washington is a perfect example of it! What's next after that? A 200nm ring of ""training warning area"" around the ""training area"" around the ADIZ around the FRZ around P56?I'm going to pass on one other ironic take on this speculation of the ""fear of airspace"" as a contributing cause of the accident. And that is the fact that they were probably very, very aware of exactly where the Class B was, due to the great technology in the airplane consisting of the GPS and moving map. I personally think the capabilities that these great avionics have brought to us contribute positively to safety, not only in positional awareness but of course also with the features of TAWS, C-Max, TCAD, etc. No way would I give these up - they're wonderful tools! But you have to ask yourself, would the looming red Class B ""there be dragons"" artificially FAA-fear-enforced line have been so apparent in the cockpit of a Tailorcraft? I don't think so. You know, they might just have busted the Class B - and lived.",23:06:00,Friday

Aerodynamics,3,Aileron gap seals,https://www.cirruspilots.org/copa/member/sr_aircraft/w/copapedia/461.aileron-gap-seals.aspx,No, Roger Whittier,2014-05-09,0,"Why gap seal?95% of a gap seal's benefit is for increased cruise speed. The high pressure air beneath the wing literally creates a vertical curtain of high pressure air chord wise along the upper surface of the wing at the leading edge of the aileron -or flap.Visualize one of those high velocity air curtains they use at the doors to air conditioned stores and industrial freezers. Now imagine that blowing UP from that gap on your wing. It is aerodynamically like maybe a two inch metal fence. ROUGH numbers to get an idea of the flat plate area of 72"" x 2"" per aileron (double that because there are two ailerons) you MIGHT have a factor of TWO square feet of additional frontal area adding drag to cruise flight!Cirrus aircraft aileron gap seal is shown on the image below.Low speed benefitNow despite the dire warnings... the removal of the aileron gap seals will actually IMPROVE low speed handling!Why?Because at high angles of attack the downward deflected aileron is actually REALLY at a high angle of attack and is pretty close to the stall if not already there. The downward deflection of the aileron at or near the WING stall speed causes that aileron to become stalled long before the wing stalls. At that point is is not much of a wing, it may as well be a sheet of plywood or your kid's arm ""flying"" out the car window driving down the highway. It is only providing flat plate lift from the bottom and NOTHING from the upper aileron surface.BUT.... if you remove the aileron gap seal at low airspeeds/high angle of attack, you will have a nice flow of air between the trailing edge of the wing and the forward curve of the leading edge of the aileron! This airflow is relatively slow now so it will allow the aileron to continue to ""fly"" a little longer and deeper towards the wing stall.Kind of like a crude Fowler flap or a leading edge slat on the heavy iron!So, the aileron gap seals improve cruise performance and MAY reduce aileron effectiveness near the wing stall.Why not flap gap seal?This is why FLAP gap seals aren't generally used, The effect of the flaps in cruise is insignificant when balanced against the decrease in effectiveness in lowering stall/landing speeds!All of this was borne out in the STC process flight testing that I was involved in many years ago.In fact, Roy LoPresti never did offer a flap gap seal for the exact reasons I just explained.We did because post 1961 Comanche's had full fowler flaps and the flap gap seals really didn't do anything detrimental to the low speed handling. Cruise performance improvements were less than 1 knot @ 150 KIAS and were not repeatable so they are pretty much ineffective. Jim figures adding an extra couple of strip of aluminum for $20 would help justify the $1000 cost.So you'd get FOUR strips instead of two!!!!In summary, IF I had have lost an aileron gap seal prior to the Cirrus Decoration I would not have flown (hey I'm not a test pilot!) unless it was an EMERGENCY... And then *I* would have certainly removed the other seal because asymmetrical ANYTHING that far out on the wing can't be a good thing if I happen to find myself DEEP into an aerodynamic corner.. no matter how insignificant!References:from the forums:I was heavily involved with my late friend Jim Bradshaw when we as Knots 2 U developed aileron and flap gap seals on the Comanche line.",00:28:00,Friday

It was developed with inspiration from the Bonanza Pilot Proficiency Program (BPPP) by Robert Price in 2003. As of February 2007 over 700 pilots have attended the training. It is targeted as advanced annual refresher training for COPA Pilots, and is generally held on a weekend. Current information about the program is available here: CPPP course schedule.The primary objective of CPPPis to enable pilots to operate their aircraft with greater confidence, safety and enjoyment. Safety comes from many facets of a pilot's knowledge base; including plane handling, weather knowledge and utilizing the advanced avionics the COPA Pilot has available. As pilots we get satisfaction from executing a text book approach and take pride after a smooth landing. Most of us review our performance after every flight. Nonetheless, the safety performance of SR2x pilots to date has not met our high expectations and the inherent safety advantages of the aircraft are not being realized. We hope that CPPP will help us all be safer pilots!In addition, we hope that CPPP will help lower insurance costs for our members. As we all know, the cost of insuring our SR2x aircraft has been a major component of our total operating costs. COPA/CPPP has met with major underwriters to discuss the CPPP, SR2x aircraft in general, and provide demonstration flights; these efforts have been well received by the underwriters. In addition, we have sought some form of formal discount program for CPPP participation; to date, these efforts have been unsuccessful. However, several of the underwriters have indicated that participation in recurrent training in general is likely to influence their assessment of pilot-specific risk and, therefore, may lead to a lower individual premium. Participants are encouraged to include information on CPPP attendance at the time their broker renews their insurance policy.""",00:25:00,Friday

He goes on to propose an eight-step judgment model which describes the judgment process as proceeding from problem vigil through action (see Jensen, 1995, Figure 2.1, pg 37). Jensen suggests that this eight-step model may be broken into two parts, consisting of rational judgment, which encompass the first five steps of the model, and motivational judgment, which encompasses the remaining three steps. Jensen (pg 53) defines these as: ?€?Rational judgment: The ability to discover and establish the relevance of all available information relating to problems of flight, to diagnose these problems, to specify alternative courses of action and to assess the risk associated with each alternative. Motivational judgment: The motivation to choose and execute a suitable course of action within the available time frame. Where: a. The choice could be either action or no action and, b. ?€?Suitable?€? is a choice consistent with ?€?societal?€? norms.?€? From this definition, it is clear that judgment is a multidimensional construct, which incorporates the impact of both cognitive and personality constructs. Judgment reflects the bringing together of a large number of aspects of a person?€?s skill repertoire, knowledge, and personality. It is not a single construct, in the sense of intelligence or locus of control, but rather a meta-construct. In addition, judgment contains an evaluative or outcome component. Judgment, by its name, implies a degree of correctness instead of error, of success as opposed to failure. This aspect is reflected in Jensen?€?s definition through the inclusion of the ?€?suitable?€? restriction.<please further identify the 'Jensen' reference><please edit and add material>""",23:12:00,Friday

These transmitters are intented to assist search and rescue personnel find aircraft in the event of an accident. They are automatically activated in an accident by a Gz switch.  A hard landing, and sometimes a not so hard landing, can also activate the ELT, so you should always monitor 121.5  before shut down.ELTs were mandated in 1973. All early ELTs transmitted an analog emergency signal on 121.5 MHz frequency. Use of this frequency and technology had significant drawbacks in terms of facilitating the location and rescue of downed airman, and in recent years, ELTs which operate on the 406MHz frequency have become available. These improved ELTs transmit a more powerful digital signal and provide a much more accurate location.  They also still include a 121.5 MHz signal for homing purposes since most Search and Rescue DF equipment still operate on 121.5 MHz.For a comparison of 121.5 and 406 MHz ELTs, see:  http://www.equipped.org/406_vs_1215.htm 406 MHz ELTs are expected to gain wider acceptance as both OEM and retrofit equipment in general aviation aircraft.  The SR-22 G3 now includes a 406 MHz ELT as standard equipment. The monitoring of 121.5 MHz frequencies by the COSPAS-SARSAT satellite system will be discontinued as of February 1, 2009. Once the satellite monitoring of 121.5 MHz frequencies is discontinued, ELTs operating on the 121.5 MHz frequency will provide little value to accident aircraft or survivors. Simply put, there is a good chance no one will hear the signal and it will need to be reported by a passing aircraft or a nearby ATC facility that monitors 121.5 MHz.  Even then, the location is not provided and a time consuming search will need to be conducted.  Some aviators are electing to replace their 121.5 MHz ELTs with an upgraded 406 MHz ELT. Generally, an upgrade to a 406 MHz ELT costs between $1,500 and $2,500 depending on the unit selected and installation costs.  An alternative to this is to carry a 406 MHz Personal Locator Beacon (PLB).  While A PLB does not have the automatic activation feature of an ELT, it is far more reliable.You can register your U.S. ELT at http://www.beaconregistration.noaa.gov rNOAA is discontinuing sending out a Registration Decal after you register your ELT as it served no useful purpose.  If you happen to receive one of these decals as they phase them out, you can just throw it away.",23:19:00,Friday

It is absolutely great. I used it on two back-to-back long flying days this week and I love it. To begin with the connula is much less obtrusive (is has no mustache attachment) and seems to be made out of softer material. I can eat a sandwich with out taking it off. Best of all is the O2D2 system. It fits in the console with one O2 hose coming from the overhead. It needs lower pressure than the ship's system so I have a small inline regulator. Then you plug one or two cannulas into the O2D2 and the top mounted controls are easy to reach and see by lifting the console lid. In use, the O2 pulse is very short and it occurs at the beginning of the breath. This conserves O2 and it saves the nasal membranes from too much dry air. Best of all the O2D2 has an internal system and it senses the altitude and adjusts the pulse accordingly. The result is FADEC for the nose. I did not have to fuss with any settings and I flew between 7,000 and 17,000 feet. My O2 saturation stayed between 92% and 96% the whole time. There are a lot more details about the O2D2 but the bottom line is how easy it is to use and how it almost eliminates the drying effects of O2 use. I have not tested it with the blue mask yet. I will as soon as I get the correct hose for that.(Oxygen) all comes from the same port, it has the same moisture content, nil. The only difference between medical, welders and aviation O2 is the paperwork and certifications. r...rWhen oxygen is used in a medical setting, after exiting the tank it is sometimes passed through water to humidify it for patient comfort (or more). The stuff in the supply tank is however, bone dry!""",23:20:00,Friday

Another big advantage of Ft. Pierce is that customs, FBO and the restaurant are all right next to each other. 4 person Rental rafts typically weigh about 12 pounds.Life preservers may be considered an alternative for rafts in the carribbean, but life preservers are inadequate for cold bodies of water like the great lakes.A Winslow Life RaftMember CommentsIf you happen to be by Fort Lauderdale, contact http://www.survivalproductsinc.com/ and you can rent from them.You can even rent the EPRIB. They do require a deposit (full value) and it is $10 bucks a day for the raft.If Ft Pierce is on your way, stop there at the Tiki Hut (next door to Customs). Although always busy, they are very helpful. Agree that if this is a one time trip, a rental will probably be OK. In addition to the raft, I carry sospenders, lights, flare kit, and perhaps most importantly, and EPIRBYou might want to check out http://www.equipped.org/raftstoc.htmA low end raft is better than nothing. A winslow raft weighs about 30 pounds and takes a seat.Survival Products and EAM tend to be the King of the rental rafts. They are the cheapest, and in rafts, you get what you pay for. For a rental, it is probably satisfactory (besides as a rental, what alternatives do you have?), but if you were going to buy one, I would certainly start with Winslow.The Winslow Island Flyer Light with an inflatable floor for the colder waters up north would be my personal choice and recommendation, and with your typical load of 2 people, the weight (approx 32 lbs) shouldn't cause you any grief.However, assuming you are carrying a PLB, you could probably get by with a RescueRaft2 with an inflatable floor and ballast bags given the likelihood of a relatively quick rescue on those routes. What you are giving up with that configuration is primarily the canopy.I am not a big fan of single cell life rafts, but a standard RescueRaft would likely prove adequate. I would still get the inflatable floor option and add ballast bags to the RescueRaft.Bottom line is that even the most basic RescueRaft would likely save your butt, the Island Flyer or additional options for the RescueRafts provide higher margins of survival capability to deal with more difficult circumstances and will also serve to make the experience far less harrowing and much, much more comfortable. In marginal conditions, it could make a life or death difference. Unless you have a really strong reason to choose a lesser performing raft, I'd still recommend the Island Flyer. If you ever have to use it, you and your wife will appreciate the added capability.The canopied Island Flyer can also serve quite nicely as a very effective inland survival shelter, sort of an inflatable tent. For that matter, you can also invert the RescueRaft and create a pretty good improvised shelter as well.life raft review""",00:09:00,Friday

It needs to be on advance of entering icing if it is to protect you. I read 90 minutes as how long you could flirt with an area of potential ice (leaving it on should you suddenly need it for the 180 escape), not how long you could run it in ice. ----I would never own TKS in a Cirrus. It eats useful load and does not let me do flights I would otherwise not do. Singles, no matter how highly evolved, do not belong in ice. ----I definitely had a false sense of security in my first year of owning my Cirrus. I was a 100 hour pilot with a new Instrument Ticket. I picked up my plane in Duluth and flew home to San Diego with the instructor. We immediately flew into snow around Denver, trying to stay on the east side of a major front. Why not we had TKS and it worked. In the first year I iced 3 times attempting to beat systems. I believe this forum, and CPPP, have attributed to my safer attitude and last two years ice free. ----I do not think Cirrus intends anyone to stay in ice for 90 minutes. But that convenience allows for 18 5 minute encounters to get out of ice. So you do not have to keep filling up the reservoir after each flight in the winter. ----Many of the pilots flying around in SR22's have very little experience in ice. The Cirrus wing, ice and a pilot with little experience in ice, is a accident. Too many people think with KI the ice issue will just go away- it just buys a few min.s at best. Fly a Cirrus in ice and your taking a big, big chance.What hasn't been said about TKS? Uncertified and limited. Slows the aircraft down a few knots. In three years, I have not needed it once (pleasure flying in the South). Icing will bring this plane down (with or without TKS). This option seems to sucker pilots into trying to go through visible moisture near freezing temperatures. The CPPP weather segment is taught by a guy that flies out of Chicago without TKS on his plane. Take this course - it is a eye opener.Icing experiences""",00:08:00,Friday
Safety procedures,3,Alternator 1 failure procedure,https://www.cirruspilots.org/copa/member/sr_aircraft/w/copapedia/481.alternator-1-failure-procedure.aspx,No, Roger Whittier,2014-05-08,0,"Rather than continuing to gripe about the inadequacies of the electrical system in our airplanes, I thought it might be helpful for pilots to work through the myriad issues that arise when Alt 1 fails from the convenience of their home. This way perhaps it won?€?t be a stiff challenge when this situation arises in the air. Bear in mind that an Alt 1 failure can be extremely challenging in either VFR or IFR conditions, depending on the remaining time in flight, so advance preparation and familiarity with the situation is crucial.Like the precautionary words on icing (?€?land now?€?) the POH does not offer much in the way of ?€?news you can use?€? when it comes to anticipating and dealing with an electrical system failure. Sure, ?€?land now?€? is prudent advice, but that isn?€?t always practical.ContentsHere are my perspectives on this issue:1. Pre-flight preparation:2. Signs of failure3. Troubleshooting4. Take action5. The Decision Tree:6. Conserve Mode:Here are my perspectives on this issue:1. Pre-flight preparation:Set up your avionics so that it is easier to identify and cope with a failure of Alt 1. Specifically:a. Put the ?€?Switch Fuel Tanks?€? message onto Garmin 1, since you can?€?t expect to have Garmin 2 or the analog fuel gauges available after an Alt 1 failure. Or keep track of fuel tank changes using paper and your watch.b. Ensure that the flight plan is loaded onto Garmin 1, since you can?€?t expect to have Garmin 2 available after an Alt 1 failure. I?€?m sure virtually all pilots already do this, but one can?€?t be too sure.c. Set up the data blocks on the Map page of the MFD to include Volts: this will display the voltage for the main bus and the essential bus. When Alt 1 falters, you?€?ll see the first number (main bus) drop and turn yellow as Bat 1 takes over and provides only 24 volts instead of the 28 volts that are normally supplied by Alt 1. Sometimes this happens minutes before the annuciator light comes on, but it?€?s a sure sign of an impending Alt 1 failure. The Emax page provides the same information.d. Set the ammeter gauge to the middle setting (BATT). In normal operation, the AMP side of the gauge (the right dial) will show zero. When Alt 1 fails, the gauge will show a negative value as Bat 1 begins to drain and it becomes the sole source of power to the main bus.2. Signs of failureThe POH is complete in discussing how to detect an Alt 1 failure. The annunciator will light up ?€?Alt 1?€?; the volts reading on the Emax or Map pages of the MFD will show less than 28V for the main bus; and the ammeter will show a negative value for Amps when the toggle switch is in the middle setting (BATT).3. TroubleshootingThe POH and emergency checklist are complete in this area as well: turn off the Alt 1 master switch, pull the Alt 1 circuit breaker, reset the breaker, look for the annunciator light to go off and for the volts reading to show 28V on the main bus. Good luck: I?€?ve never heard of a false Alt 1 failure. Once the annunciator comes on or the main bus shows less than 28 volts, the alternator is already non-functional and no amount of breaker-pulling is going to bring it back to life. Therefore I wouldn?€?t spend alot of time on this troubleshooting exercise.4. Take actionYou?€?re now reconciled to the reality that Alt 1 is gone. Its time to Aviate, Navigate and Communicate. So make sure:a. The autopilot is onb. The flight plan on Garmin 1 is current and that you?€?re navigating directly to the correct waypointc. Set Garmin 1 to the map page (NAV page two) either in track up or north up mode (strictly a matter of personal preference)d. Scroll the Garmin map to an appropriate distance so that you can confirm the situational awareness that will be lost when the MFD goes blank.e. Follow the Decision Tree below and choose a destination airport.f. Call ATC and advise that you ?€?need to divert to the (new) destination airport due to an electrical system failure?€?. If the Decision Tree favors Conserve mode (i.e., turning off Bat 1 and pulling many circuit breakers), tell ATC that you ?€?will soon lose your transponder, due to the need to conserve battery power for approach and landing.?€? FYI, in the aftermath of September 11, even without a transponder ATC will still be able to see your plane as a primary target, but expect to be asked to report reaching a given altitude or fix.g. If the Decision Tree favors Conserve mode (by turning off Bat 1), be aware that the audio panel will no longer function. This means that ANR headsets (e.g., Bose) will only work out of one ear in mono mode, and it will be impossible to talk to passengers. The MFD will be gone, as well as Garmin 2, Traffic Watch, Stormscope, cabin lights and the accessory power outlet. Don?€?t expect to use these devices for the remainder of the trip.5. The Decision Tree:The POH is not helpful in analyzing which circuit breakers to pull in order to shed load once Alt 1 is gone. Nor does it adequately describe what will happen if you don?€?t switch to Conserve mode by turning off Bat 1 so as to save its precious power for when it will be needed. These are critical decisions that need to be analyzed in order to be able to safely fly the plane and land without undue complications or pilot workload. This section outlines the decision tree that I?€?ve developed to maximize available electrical power and minimize pilot workload and complexity for the remainder of the flight. The key question to ask is: What is the remaining time to the original destination?a. If the remaining time to the original destination is less than 30 minutes and VMC prevails for the remainder of the trip, then Conserve mode is not necessary. So leave Bat 1 on and fly normally. You will have all of the capabilities of the plane for the remainder of the flight.b. If the remaining time to the original destination is less than 30 minutes and IMC prevails for all or part of the remainder, consider using Conserve mode by shutting down Bat 1 until the approach/landing phase of the flight. This will conserve the electrical power necessary to safely fly the plane in case you end up with a missed approach and need to spend additional time flying to an alternate airport. See Section 6 below for a discussion of which circuit breakers to pull so that Conserve mode is in effect when Bat 1 is turned back on.c. If the remaining time to the original destination is more than 30 minutes, you should consider diverting to a closer airport. If one is available and VMC prevails, then Conserve mode is not necessary. So leave Bat 1 on and fly normally. You will have all of the capabilities of the plane for the remainder of the flight.d. If the remaining time to the original destination is more than 30 minutes but there is no suitable alternate airport, you MUST enter Conserve mode. Shut down Bat 1 regardless of whether its VMC or IMC if you want a safe and uncomplicated flight. See Section 6 below for a discussion of which circuit breakers to pull so that Conserve mode is in effect when Bat 1 is turned back on, as may be necessary to change power settings, switch fuel tanks, deal with icing, or execute an approach or landing.6. Conserve Mode:The main bus (controlled by the last two columns of circuit breakers) feeds many very important flight instruments and controls, so its a huge misconception to think that the Cirrus can be safely flown just off the power to the ?€?essential bus?€? that is provided by Alt 2 and Bat 2. In other words, if Alt 1 fails but you don?€?t turn off Bat 1 shortly afterward, you won?€?t have a variety of important flight instruments and controls available for landing. These include: engine instruments, fuel gauge, flaps, pitch and roll trim, transponder, pitot heat, instrument and nav lights (night flight), TKS system, fuel pump (when switching tanks), and the strobe lights. My philosophy is to pull ALL of the circuit breakers on the main bus, EXCEPT the following:Column A (Main Bus)4 Transponder9 Engine instruments10 Instrument lights*11 Pitch trim12 Roll trim13 Ice*Column B (Main Bus):1 Fuel pump7 Pitot heat10 Strobe lights11 Nav lights*12 FlapsColumn C (Essential Bus)Don?€?t touch any of these circuit breakers*These circuit breakers should be pulled if its NOT night flight or IMCOnce the appropriate circuit breakers have been pulled, you can turn Bat 1 back on for selected functions without having to worry about wasting power on non-important devices (e.g., Traffic Watch or Stormscope) that also occupy the main bus.When it comes time to switch fuel tanks, turn on pitot heat or TKS, or change a power setting, switch on Bat 1 for the minimal amount of time that is necessary to accomplish those tasks. When it comes time to shoot an approach or enter the landing pattern, switch on Bat 1 so that power settings, flaps and trim can become functional.At all other times, fly the airplane only from Alt 2 and Bat 2, using only the autopilot, Garmin 1 and PFD to aviate and navigate. Forget about having the MFD, Garmin 2, transponder, Traffic Watch, Stormscope, audio panel, cabin lights or the accessory power outlet are not available once Alt 1 fails and Bat 1 and the main bus circuit breakers are set up for Conserve mode.",00:18:00,Thursday
Training and proficiency,3,Are we psychologically preapred to use the chute,https://www.cirruspilots.org/copa/member/sr_aircraft/w/copapedia/483.are-we-psychologically-preapred-to-use-the-chute.aspx,No, Roger Whittier,2014-05-08,0,"100% of the time, if you're going to pull the CAPS, touch your forehead (or the top of your head) first. Doesn't matter which, as long as you always use the same place, somewhere close to the CAPS handle. Then reach for the CAPS. Practice the maneuver until your muscles have learned it.Reason:In an abnormal g situation (i.e. anything that's not 1 g), finding the CAPS handle may be a challenge. Your arm itself can weigh much more (or less) than usual, and it feels really weird. But, assuming the g-force isn't so exteme that you can't move at all (I suspect lack of consciousness happens before that), you will have much less trouble finding a part of your own body, thanks to proprioception and kinesthesia. Here's a good discussion on both.By the time you've found your forehead, you've already figured out the muscular ""effort offset"" needed to counteract the g-forces you're experiencing, so finding the handle - always at the same relative location to your head - should be easier. In reality, depending on the situation, the g-forces may be in flux while you're moving, so it may *still* be a challenge to find the handle.Alan Klapmeier survived a mid-air collision, and that the event was instrumental in the ultimate decision to incorporate CAPS into the design of the Cirrus. I've thought about that one lots - what could the g-forces be like in an airplane missing one wing? both wings? it's elevator? spinning? tumbling? I don't know... just hope that if it ever happens to me, I can find my head, then use it - to find the CAPS handle. It would likely ruin my whole day to reach for the handle and miss when there are only seconds to impact.Exercise:In order to keep myself psychologically prepared (and aware) of the CAPS, I usually do a little exercise at least once per (solo) trip. I don't do this with passengers on board - it would be too disconcerting.While flying along, I'll say (aloud) ""BANG!"" - which to me means ""something very bad just happened"". For some reason, I imagine a mid-air collision, but obviously it could be almost anything. I'll sometimes run my fuel/mixture/pump/alternate air/mag check at this point, for good measure. In all cases, I then touch my forehead with my right hand, then reach for the CAPS handle and touch it with the back of my hand.The reason for the forehead-then-handle move is that I want to have the muscle-memory of where that handle is. I figure that I may be fighting significant G's, but I'll always know where my forehead is... that handle is always in the same position relative to my head... so finding my head, then the handle, should always work. I use the back of my hand to touch the handle for obvious reasons.I only hope that if anyone listens to my CVR files many years from now, when I'm not around to explain the odd ""BANG!"" yelled out when I'm alone, they'll also read this post...The CAPS pin is out and the cover is off for EVERY flight. To replace the checklist that's printed on that cover, I have a laminated enhanced checklist that's loosely attached to the handle.",00:05:00,Thursday

From a pilots point of view, inside the cockpit, it looks and flys like a Cirrus SR22, and it can be very effective for pilot training. A simple joystick is required to operate FSX and Avidyne Student.An alternative to Avidyne Student with FSX is the SR20 and SR22 aircraft from Eaglesoftdiscussed here in COPApedia. By comparison the Avidyne avionics are considerably improved with the Avidyne Student implementation. The airspeed and altitude tapes on the PFD are more realistic and the MFD has more capability, including a map with terrain, airspace, waypoints and airways, and there is a TAWS page. The S-TEC 55X performance with Student is more realistic and more compatible with step approaches than with the Eaglesoft aircraft.Avidyne Student is set up in the screen shot below for the ILS 25L approach at KLAS. Note the terrain on the MFD and the Class B depiction.RealityXP GNS430W add-onAvidyne Student works well with the RealityXP Garmin 430W add-on and this is ideal for Cirrus IFR simulation since this add-on looks and performs like a real Garmin 430W; flight plans are entered and stored, approaches selected, it can do WAAS approaches (see Addendum) and it has a terrain display. The built-in Flight1 Garmin 430s work okay when the Microsoft Flight Simulator flight planner is used, but the RealityXP Garmin 430W is more realistic for most operations.This add-on GPS can be installed easily in the lower right of the screen with the Reality XP GNS WAAS FSX Config program, or it can be incorporated into the panel and radio stack with a custom panel modification discussed in the Addendum at the end of this article.Shown below is the panel with both the RealityXP 430W and the STEC 55X popped up so all the primary avionics can be directly operated. The aircraft is on an approach to KVNY ILS Rwy 16R, in clouds and rain.Windows 7 and 64 bit computersMost new PCs run 64 bit Windows 7. All three of the software components, FSX, Avidyne Student and Reality XP 430W are compatible with Win 7 64 bit (as well as earlier Windows operating systems). A fast computer with a good graphics card is required for the best graphics performance with FSX. Both Avidyne Student and Reality XP GNS430W require FSX SP1 to be installed. Use the latest versions of all the software, and read and follow the instructions to install and operate each program.LimitationsThere are limitations within the FSX framework that mean there are differences between the operation and performance of the simulator and a real Cirrus aricraft. Some time spent running the simulator will show most of these limitations for a pilot already familiar with Cirrus avionics.Addendum - Panel ModificationsWarning! Flight1 Aviation Technologies does not support modified software. You may need to reinstall the software if a modification is not performed correctly. Only perform the modifications if you are comfortable backing up and editing configuration files.Insert the Reality XP GNS430W into the Avidyne Student PanelWith this modificationThe #1 GPS is replaced in the panel and in the radio stack with the Reality XP Garmin 430W (while leaving the built-in Garmin 430 as the #2 GPS)The normal Reality XP panel interface is eliminated and the Reality XP 430W is completely integrated into the Avidyne Student interfaceThe panel can be modified by editing the Panel.cfg file in the program files folder.

Fortunately, they are not frequent. As a general aviation pilot, you are far less likely to be asked to show your pilot certificate(s) and medical than is a professional pilot. Nevertheless, the FAA does send out its inspectors to do ramp checks from time to time.By and large the event is painless, if dealing with the FAA can ever be so described. The FAA inspector will approach you and identify him or herself and tell you it is a ramp check. He or she should be willing to provide identification if you ask. Ask. Upon request, the inspector must provide a government issued picture ID and FAA Form 110A (inspector's authorization document). The FAA badge is not sufficient to conduct ramp inspection. Inspector must follow FAA Order 8000.38G credentials. A ramp check usually takes less than five minutes. Pilots overwhelmingly report that the FAA inspectors are polite and businesslike during ramp inspections.Write down the person's name and the FAA office at which s/he works. 99% of the FAA inspectors are reasonable folks; be prepared for the unreasonable one by asking someone who is nearby to stand with you as a witness.

They are well trained in dealing with that and it's a great way to turn a simple ramp check into an ugly scene in which the inspector assumes you have something to hide and is going to search until s/he finds it. He or she doesn't really want to be there, so the best way to deal with the inspector is to be polite.There are things you are required to do and things you are not required to do during a ramp check. It's wise to know which is which.Keep in mind that if a person starts asking you about something you have been doing, that is NOT a ramp check. If anyone asks you about a flight you've just made or what you have been doing even ten seconds in the past, that is an investigation, something completely different from a ramp check. Ask the person for identification and then why s/he is asking you questions. If it is an FAA or other law enforcement official, you do not have to answer any questions. If in doubt, politely indicate that you would rather not answer at the present time and write down the person's name and telephone number so that you may contact him or her after you speak with your lawyer.Personal DocumentsIf asked by an FAA inspector or a law officer (some states, such as Illinois, have their state troopers also conduct ramp checks), you must show the following:Your pilot's certificateYour medical certificatePicture ID you must also have in your possession a drivers license or other government issued ID with your photo.It is okay to hand the documents to the FAA inspector. It is not considered a ""surrender"" of your certificate to hand it to the inspector. By regulation, the only way to surrender your certifiate(s) is to do so in writing. There is an old wive's tale still running around that says you should not hand your certifcate to an FAA employee or the employee may keep it and consider it a surrender. It's not true. During a public question and answer session, the FAA attorney in charge of the Great Lakes Region said that if he ever heard of an FAA inspector attempting to claim a pilot surrendered his certificate during a ramp check because it was handed to the inspector, that inspector's next assignment, if he weren't fired, would be in Nome. There have been attempts to find a pilot who has had an FAA inspector try to keep his or her certificate - none have been successful. It's always wound up along the lines of, ""my third cousin knew a lineboy who talked with a charter pilot who saw it happen to a guy...""Aircraft DocumentsIf asked by an FAA inspector, you must show the following aircraft documents (you should remove them from the aircraft yourself - no FAA inspector or law enforcment officer may enter your airplane without your permission, unless a search warrant is obtained - s/he may look in the window for objects in plain sight):Airworthiness certificate with correct N numberRegistration certificate with correct N numberPOHWeight and Balance/Operating LimitationsThe chances of you getting hit by lightning are greater than the chances of an FAA inspector trying to keep your documents, however, should the inspector take any of your documents or try to leave with any of your documents, call local law enforcement office (911) to get your documents back and to enforce the violation of 49 USC 46306(b)(4).LogbooksYou must provide your logbook and the aircraft logbooks for examination if requested. However, you do not need to do it during the ramp inspection. If asked for them, tell the inspector that you will do so and make an appointment to bring them to his or her office. (Unless you are a student pilot on a solo flight, why do you haver your logbook with you? - Plus, keeping the aircraft logbooks in the airplane is an excellent way to make the airplane that much more attractive as a theft target or increase the risk of losing them.)Before you provide the logbooks for examination (and copying, if desired) by the FAA, make sure they are up to date. DO NOT make any false entries. That is a felony, the penalty is far worse for that than for something that is missing in a logbook.You do not have to provide any additional documentsYou are not required to have current VFR charts when you fly and the FAA may not insist that you have them as part of a ramp check (for Part 91 operations). Should there be a question of being familiar with all available information for your flight, it's a good idea to have the current sectional, however, there are other methods of compliance and that issue is one that is outside the realm of a ramp check because it is asking you about something you did in the past and is thus an investigation.You do not have to provide your weight and balance calculation for a flight you are about to make or just made, nor do you need to do one right then and there.Be Polite But Limit Your ConversationDo not volunteer information during the ramp check. Be polite and limit your conversation to precisely what is being requested and then be quiet. Do not babble, do not chat about aviation-related subjects. If you must talk, comment on the nice/bad weather in the area last week or the potential for the local sports team this year. If you are asked to do something that you feel is outside of a ramp check, politely decline and use the word ""cooperate"" as the inspector has a form s/he may have to fill out that asks about cooperation of the subject (you). ""Mr./Ms. Inspector, I want to fully cooperate with you and will do so, but before we go any further with this conversation I need to call an aviation attorney to make sure of my rights."" The inspector is trained to accept that answer. Do not, at any time, be rude or difficult, just polite and firm. It may mean you'll need to call the inspector on the phone later on, but stopping if you are uncomfortable and checking with an attorney is better than continuing to talk and getting yourself in a jam because you didn't know something.No arrest or detention authorityAn FAA inspector has no power to arrest or detain you. An inspector may not in any way hinder you in the performance of your airman's duties or in the exercising of your pilot's privileges.There are a lot more bits and pieces of your rights. I suggest reading J. Scott Hamilton's ""Practical Aviation Law"" for an in-depth coverage of the subject.",00:05:00,Friday
Training and proficiency,3,Microsoft Flight Simulator,https://www.cirruspilots.org/copa/member/sr_aircraft/w/copapedia/487.microsoft-flight-simulator.aspx,No, John Ylinen,2014-05-07,0,"ContentsMicrosoft Flight Simulator X (FSX) and the Eaglesoft SR20 or SR22 are useful tools to help maintain instrument proficiency.OverviewRequirementsSetting Up and Basic OperationInstalling and running FSXInstalling the SR22 (or SR20 or Turbo SR22)Installing the Reality XP 430WPitfalls - Differences from the Real WorldExtensions and ModificationsMicrosoft Flight Simulator X (FSX) and the Eaglesoft SR20 or SR22 are useful tools to help maintain instrument proficiency.OverviewAre six Cirrus approaches in six months not enough to keep you sharp?Do you want to hone your skills with the Avidyne, Garmin and S-Tec systems?Would you like to practice ""partial panel"" with the PFD out BEFORE it happens for real?Are you prepared to navigate to the nearest airport with the engine out?A Cirrus Simulator can be an aid for all of these things, and much more. In July 2005 the Eaglesoft Design Group introduced the SR-20 aircraft for Microsoft Flight Simulator and right away it attracted COPA Pilots as a possible instrument simulator. Eaglesoft followed later that year with the SR-22. The G3 Turbo, including wide screen versions, was introduced in 2008. While the Eaglesoft aircraft include Garmin 430s they are not close enough to actual 430s to be useful for instrument practice. Fortunately Reality XP provides an add on GNS430W which is a very close simulation, and in fact is driven by the Garmin 430W simulator. This software combination of FSX, the Eaglesoft SR-20 or SR-22, and a Reality XP 430W provides a realistic simulation to help maintain instrument proficiency in Cirrus aircraft.Also consider Avidyne Student as a Cirrus flight simulator. Both the Eaglesoft SR2x aircraft and Avidyne Student can be installed and either selected from FSX.RequirementsA capable PC running Windows 7 (or Vista or XP). All the software runs with the OS that comes on most new PCs, 64 bit Windows 7.Microsoft Flight Simulator X, also FSX SP1 is required; SP2 is recommendedEaglesoft SR22 (or SR20) orEaglesoft Turbo SR22Reality XP 430WA compatible joystickAll the software and the joystick add up to about $146.Setting Up and Basic OperationIf you are just starting out the logical sequence is to install FSX and the joystick first and if you are not familiar with FSX learn to run it; next download and install the Eaglesoft SR22 (or SR20 or Turbo SR22) and learn how to operate the Cirrus aircraft with FSX; and finally download and install the Reality XP 430W.Installing and running FSXInstallation from the DVDs is straightforward. Next install the joystick. Depending on how familiar you are with FSX the program has a selection of tutorials and pre-established flights to help get you up to speed. However all Cirrus Flight Simulator functions start from the FREE FLIGHT command. Create and fly several flights, VFR and IFR, using some of the aircraft that come with MSFS. Note the EXTREMELY useful WEATHER capability - Real world weather (updated every 15 minutes). With this option selected FSX downloads aviation weather so you can always fly in current conditions anywhere (of course you can also select fake weather from very nice to really rotten).Installing the SR22 (or SR20 or Turbo SR22)Download and install the Eaglesoft SR22 (or SR20 or Turbo SR22). Carefully follow all of the Eaglesoft instructions and the installation will go smoothly. An easy point to miss is loacting the operating instructions. These are placed in the folderc:Eaglesoft Development GroupESDG DocumentationCOPA Pilots have the huge advantage that they already know how to operate the Cirrus, the Avidyne PFD and MFD, the S-Tec 55X, and the Garmin 430W. However, read each of the manuals to understand how the avionics works within FSX. Finally, the Cirrus SR2X Cockpit Layout Manual is a ""must read"" and key to understanding how to operate the Cirrus in MSFS. Take several flights with the Cirrus until you are comfortable operating this aircraft.Installing the Reality XP 430WDownload and install the Reality XP GNS 430W. Again carefully follow the instructions from Reality XP. Also note that the Reality XP 430W installation also installs the Garmin 430W Trainer.Run XP Gns WAASS FSX Config  and scroll down through the available aircraft panels - selectCirrus Eaglesoft Cirrus SR2x G2 Panel (eaglesoft cirrus sr22 g2 1.5) orCirrus Eaglesoft Cirrus SR2x G2 Panel slate (eaglesoft cirrus sr22 g2 1.5) for GTS aircraftor if you have the SR22 TurboCirrus SR22G2 Turbo PanelCirrus SR22G2 Turbo Panel WS (for the wide screen aircraft)and select Configure Aircraft. On the Panel tab check both Gns Unit and Gns 430. Align the 430W in the upper right of the screen. On the 430.1 settings tab select Auto Approach, Link CDI and Link VOR.Load a flight plan directly in the 430W and fly VFR or IFR just as with a real Cirrus. A quirk of the Reality XP 430W is that after a flight plan is loaded the right mouse button must be clicked two times over the FPL button to ""move"" the flight plan to the FSX Flight Planner, and then it must be loaded back into the aircraft to display on the MFD and PFD. Take several flights and become familiar with the Reality XP 430W.Pitfalls - Differences from the Real WorldEaglesoft aircraft do NOT show glideslope on the PFD for WAAS approaches. Also the autopilot does not track glideslope for WAAS approaches. There are limitations within the FSX framework that mean there are differences between the operation of the simulator and a real Cirrus aircraft. Some time spent running the simulator will show most of these limitations for a pilot already familiar with Cirrus avionics.Extensions and ModificationsThere are almost limitless numbers of add ons available for FSX; it is after all the most popular computer game in the world. For example see PC Aviator for add on software for everything from outstanding scenery to a huge variety of other aircraft to fly. There is also a large variety of add on hardware; CH Products is a good place to start looking.",23:12:00,Wednesday
