0,SMXgbQyD-_E,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMXgbQyD-_E,COPA 2020 New forums preview - iphone,,49,"Apr 2, 2020",4:21,everybody at Gundersen here with the serious owners and Pilots Association as I promised on Facebook and I also wanted to put this up on YouTube here is the forums page on a mobile device so here I am on the forums now I can click at the top there to get the look of website you'll see we're right now we're in read-only mode and emails are disabled as we do the import so this is kind of just again a sneak peek to here's so I'm on the cata main categories page and you can see all the different categories I have here but we can go and there's actually a bunch of settings we can change what your start page is and so most people will probably set it to the latest so here's the latest if we scroll down I keep on going into this tornado forum and of course we can go ahead and scroll all the way to the top and it has a feature what they call infinite scroll so you really never get to the top or the bottom of the page until you're finally there and I can actually show you how far along you are down there at the on the bottom down there so similar features to the main site we think it looks pretty good here on mobile some of you could come out of the margins are a little off it has some flex and play it's not a hundred percent perfect but it's pretty darn good so you can see there links are working really well and this is the new updated theme for that were using with some styling and kind of the greater background and darker text so we hope everybody likes that so here I am going through and you have the same functionality you have on the main web on the main page if you're using it from a desktop if you highlight across here I can actually click quote and I can reply straight to the quote now you'll notice there isn't a preview screen but down in the bottom right hand corner you can actually click preview and you can fast see what's going on I'm gonna hide the preview and I'll go you know let's go ahead and do then Siri to dictate that which is pretty neat and so I can click that and let's add some text here so there's that and we can go back I hide preview and I can add say a photo so if you want to add a photo you actually have to click in here and click upload then you can actually just take a photo so let's go ahead and just do that let's go ahead attempt to take a photo out my window here we use that photo and it's uploading that photo and there's actually an error because all the reason it's an arrow or a readable mode so I can't do that but that's how easy it would be so the other cool thing we can do though is we can actually still navigate the site so I can get I can click back and we can say go to the latest screen and pop in to some other forum and you can actually quote from this forum post and import that in and so if I go preview that you'll now see we have that one the first post and then add some text here idk tit in and then there's the other one that we put in so we can hide this preview it's like oh I need to get you know if you need to get back to that that post you can actually just click on the name above the post takes you back there and then won't be able to post that so I'm gonna go ahead and discard this because we couldn't we are and really mode right now and so full functionality isn't necessarily there well go ahead and abandon it go and hide that for now and there it is so a couple of different things we can look at we can hop into some settings go to preferences and this is where we can go into your account upload a new picture we can go to interface we can change from light to dark mode for example and then you can make your default you can change your text size up and down and you can change your default home screen from categories to latest now again I can't save changes there so we're not going to do that right now but you kind of get the idea so I hope you enjoy it we'll see you on the next video,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SMXgbQyD-_E/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEZCPYBEIoBSFXyq4qpAwsIARUAAIhCGAFwAQ==&rs=AOn4CLA3RYdcIOxYeLBo1S137CbkqvEicA

17,xpB9YNzmtxc,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpB9YNzmtxc,CPPP Promo Video (COPA Pilot Proficiency Program),"The COPA Pilot Proficiency Program hosted by COPA University is the best safety training program for pilots of technologically advanced aircraft, especially Cirrus airplanes. For details and schedule of safety events, see https://www.cirruspilots.org/ CPPP events are held in the United States, Europe, Brazil and Australia",1986,"Nov 29, 2018",4:59,I've loved it for as far back as I can remember part of it is I really like being the master of my fate and the captain of my soul one aspect of learning to fly is the mastery of all the various things that you need to know in order to be a successful and safe pilot everything that we do we're doing in a mechanical contraption that requires us to manage it and managing and efficiently and safely is a big part of what we need to know as aviators for better or worse for the entire history of aviation the overwhelming cause of accidents is pilot error and at the C Triple P what we try to do is give pilots good quality information about aeronautical decision making and how to fly their airplane and importantly when not to fly the airplane in order to try to keep them safe we went through a period of time in the Cirrus community where people were not prone to using their parachutes and we were having fatal accidents and it's very unfortunate a big part of learning to fly Cirrus means a primacy of rather than being all task focused on how to find the road to land on that would be task focused on when and where to pull the parachute but unfortunately the human brain in a stressful situation isn't going to respond that way unless you've trained adequately for that one of the challenges for cirrus pilots is the tendency for them to revert back to their primary training and it's really important for pilots to acknowledge that using the parachute unless they trained initially in a Cirrus is a new concept the coppa pilot proficiency program is the best recurrent training for cirrus pilots put on by the Cirrus owners and Pilots Association we deal with the innovations that Cirrus brings to the aircraft the avionics the safety features the parachute and bring an opportunity for pilots to understand what they need to learn to be able to fly safely one of the best additions in the last couple years to the sea trapeze is right here this is a fly the sim touch trainer and we've created a simulator lab which really focuses on instrument procedures and programming simulators pc-based simulator and a company that makes it has designed the Cirrus specific airframe in Avion I into the simulator so we can actually use the touchscreen and make the airplane do things that you wouldn't want to do up in the air in an actual airplane our goal here is to challenge them and to help them learn the aircraft better and what better way to do it than to put them into scenarios that make them a little uncomfortable and make them think and make them use the tools that they either have in their tool bag already or things that they learned here at the sea trip apiece today I did the partner in command class which is a class for non pilots who fly with usually their spouse I always start by asking them what they like to do in the airplane and my favorite answer so far has been I like to pray what we try to do is empower them to be able to take over should something happen to the pilot in the Cirrus they have a wonderful tool to do this namely caps the Cirrus aircraft parachute system what we want to do is we want to make them comfortable and understanding when it can be used how to use it and we try to give them some information about how to maneuver the airplane to an area where a caps deployment is much much more likely to be successful and that's what we do we try to give them the information they need to become an active crew member and that it enough itself makes them more comfortable in addition to making it safer you take away the mystery and you absolutely take away the fear these guys that want to do a lot of flying they want their partners to go with them it's the parachute that makes those partners more comfortable and so they're more willing to go flying with them so they're getting to enjoy their planes more often and we have a partner session where they come out of their class and lecture and then they actually have tactile feedback and we teach them how to actually practice what they learned in the class they took the partner command class but what we do is we empower them and we make sure that they can in case of a pilot incapacitation they can safely get that plane on the ground and save their life and hopefully the life of their partner see Triple P is a lot more than a learning session the amount of learning that happens is substantial just in informal settings you meet with many people who own the same kind of airplane you do and fly it in different manners and you can learn things from your fellow radiators in my role as aviation safety chair I work with people to understand what happened during the accident from the investigations and in many cases we have the opportunity to talk to the pilots since they pulled the chute they're available for an interview they credit specifically having changed their minds having attended a C Triple P talk to the people that have pulled the parachute talk to instructors that explained how challenging that decision can be and yet they go away with the confidence that when they reach a bad situation they can pull I found instructing pilots is that they don't know what they don't know and they tend to find a lot of those answers at a speed you will be

CPPP    https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list...",656,"Aug 13, 2017",3:10,this will be a very quick video on using joysticks and throttle quadrants with the prospective trainer I get a lot of questions regarding the trainer and errors that people are having and probably 60 to 75% of these are directly related to the use of joysticks throttle quadrants and using the keyboard as a joystick my recommendation is to not use joysticks not use throttle quadrants and to turn off the keyboard if you're trying to use that as a joystick and the way that you do that while I'm mentioning is you just go to options go to joystick access configuration and make sure this box is unchecked the trainer was never designed to be a simulator it has no flight characteristics built into it whatsoever you can climb your airspeed is not going to slow down you can descend your airspeed is not going to speed up it was really designed to be used with the autopilot on and flying it as you would typically be flying in the airplane and if you do that and use the mouse you'll find that it's a very very valuable tool and if you don't and you try to use joysticks you're probably going to have issues and it's going to be very frustrating I bought three different setups trying to see if I can get any of them to work so I could make recommendations for people that do want to use them and I'm fairly computer literate and I never got any of them to work where they would work reliably consistently and not be aggravating I would highly recommend that you look at the videos on the hardware configurations the installation and the configuration of the software if you haven't already done so and I mentioned that is in there as well time and I will leave links to that down in the description of this video below if you haven't seen those already ok let's take a look at how fast and easy it actually is with the mouse to set your air speed once you've set your air speed one time the cursor will remain on the block so it'll be very quick and easy just like it will be now to change the air speed I'm going to click my menu button two times I'm going to change that change my air speed to 120 knots press ENTER and press menu and that's it miter speed instantly changes to 120 knots realistically I can do that much faster than I could if I had a throttle quadrant and I sit here and I'm trying to jockey the throttle quadrant back and forth as I said that's not what the trainer is for so if you'll do it this way just resign yourself to the fact that it's not designed really to work with those you're going to make life a lot easier on yourself that's it for now you,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2U53JWBkG-k/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEZCPYBEIoBSFXyq4qpAwsIARUAAIhCGAFwAQ==&rs=AOn4CLAQ6rXPHdHEWeuAONzUnGA9kxAlWA

A ""strategic"" passenger briefing, designed to answer questions that first-time passengers might have when flying ""private"", or General Aviation, airplanes. Topics include pilot health and qualifications, airplane status, how to pack, what to eat, airport hazards and specifics about being around airplanes.",2241,"Mar 12, 2017",11:19,mark Las Vegas Airport ATIS information India time one three five three Zulu wind three three zero at Niner temperature to four dew point minus 2 altimeter to now seven [Music] [Music] this video is a volunteer effort by FAA safety team representatives Jana Denton and Mike Radomski of Las Vegas Nevada we gratefully acknowledge the support and encouragement of the FAA 'he's a VA ssin safety program as well as the Aviators model code of conduct this is a new type of passenger briefing video designed for general aviation passengers to view a day or two prior to their flight our goal is to provide information that will both enhance safety and provide peace of mind by answering frequently asked questions and addressing common misconceptions this amateur production is intended only as a guide in all cases prevailing laws should be followed in the event of any conflict with advice provided here we encourage pilots to share this video with their passengers please do contact us with questions or comments hello and welcome I understand you're going for a flight in a general aviation airplane you may have lots of experience flying on commercial airlines and maybe even on smaller general aviation aircraft still there are some things your pilot wants you to be aware of prior to this flight in this introductory passenger briefing you'll be introduced to several topics to ensure that you have a safe comfortable and enjoyable experience [Music] you should be comfortable and confident when it comes to your pilot's skills and abilities your pilot has undergone rigorous training and has successfully satisfied the high standards required by the FAA including recurrent skills and knowledge testing and regular medical check-ups yes excuse me thank you everything's good everything is good for another year good one more year thank you I do appreciate it thank you so much really appreciate it [Music] you should also be comfortable when you consider the reliability of the aircraft airplanes must be fit to modern airplanes are marvels of strength and reliability but they too must pass stringent checks by FAA authorized inspectors every 12 months or less and their air worthiness must be confirmed by the pilot before each flight [Music] deciding what to bring on your flight isn't necessarily a time-consuming task but it is an important one every airplane has weight and space limitations you will be permitted to keep small personal items within reach you can make it easier for your pilot to stow your main baggage if you choose a small soft sided bed you will probably be wearing a headset so avoid hats and earrings if you think they might be uncomfortable sunglasses are usually okay the inside of the aircraft is usually kept at a pleasant temperature so dress as you would for a car ride pack your dress shoes wear comfortable shoes instead unexpected weather or other factors can make it necessary for your pilot to land at an airport that is not your planned destination it is smart to pack clothes suitable for the areas you will be flying over that could mean bringing some warm clothing even in summer in many ways private airplane travel offers more freedom than commercial flights for example you may pack most cosmetic and health care products size is usually not an issue but if you have any doubt please ask your pilot it is very important that you provide your pilot with accurate weights for each passenger and all baggage this includes bags that will be stowed as well as any personal items you plan to bring onboard with you [Music] many believe that they should fly on an empty stomach to avoid being airsick in fact it is better to eat sensibly by having a small meal avoiding greasy foods and being sufficiently hydrated most general aviation airplanes do not have toilet facilities so avoid diuretics like coffee and alcohol [Music] let's listen in as mike tells us passengers what to expect on the airport ramp now to get out to the airplane we're going to need to go out on the ramp and we're going to be exposed to loud noises other airplanes moving around and some unfamiliar smells like aviation fuel now not surprisingly the ramp and the airplane itself are absolutely no smoking areas you don't smoke do you Vivian okay that's what I thought your safety is most important so stay well clear of the other airplanes and remember that propellers and helicopter rotors are dangerous even when they're not moving and they're invisible when they're spinning so that makes them even more dangerous then jet blast is also dangerous and invisible so stay with me at all times we're going to keep an especially watchful eye on the youngest among us that's you of you and I'm ready are you guys ready yeah okay let's go [Music] your pilot will perform a safety check of the aircraft prior to your flight perhaps before you arrive at the airport should you be fortunate enough to observe this interesting pre-flight inspection in person please ask any questions you may have after the inspection is complete this is an important task that demands your pilot's full attention [Music] as you port the aircraft accept the help offered to you by your pilot be careful to use the proper hand holds and to step only where instructed once you are seated your pilot will brief you on the use of a headset seatbelt and harnesses doors other equipment emergency procedures and will also explain when it's important to keep talking to a minimum it's important to pay close attention to this safety briefing a camera is not critical for the pilot but you'll be glad to have one along so that you can share your flight with others [Music] pilots use a checklist to verify that critical items are not forgotten [Music] Mike and his passengers will have a great flight from the days before the flight to the end of the trip pilots monitor many factors including the airplane and the weather to keep their passengers safe of course if at any time you do not feel comfortable please be good myk's passengers expressed concern about turbulence it does occasionally affect flights your planet doesn't like it either but airplanes are built to a standard just as a car is built to withstand driving on a dirt road come to think of it dirt roads are generally a lot bumpier than any turbulence you are likely to encounter on your flight thank you for your attention as a knowledgeable well briefed passenger you are helping to achieve an important goal for you to have a memorable enjoyable and safe experience if you have any additional questions please discuss them with your pilot

brought to you by Coppa University to learn more about the Cirrus owners and Pilots Association and cope University click the information icon in the upper right corner of the video at any time on the last screen of this video you can subscribe to this Coppa University channel so you will be notified when new videos are available this video is an actual demonstration of a complete database update including the flight charts on my local Cirrus perspective trainer system there are several steps that are necessary before that you can get to this point of updating these databases and I will cover them in detail in the installation lessons that follow but I thought it would be a good idea to show you first the end result and how quick and easy it is to update these databases once you are set up properly the perspective trainer system does not use the jeppeson the charts but if you want to update your flight charts to a much more current version if you will send me a private message on the Cirrus prospective forum up on the copa website i have a solution for you and i'll be glad to help you out i've made a document available that has all of these installation instructions in it and it also has this cheat sheet that you see on the left side of my screen at the very end of that document and that document you can find the link for it in the description of this video down below alright let's get started there first thing is there's two database locations one for 32-bit computers and another for 64-bit computers once again I go over this in detail in the installation videos in my case I'm using the 64-bit the location I set my screen up it just makes it simple for me to set my screen up where my file explorer open to Windows my bottom File Explorer window is set to my data path my main data path on my local computer that's my series trainer files on my local computer and then on my top window is where I access my SD cards as you can see right now in my G Drive my SD card my nav SD card is in my G Drive so I'm going to click on that the SD card these of course were updated I have to update my NAB card and my MFD card before I even begin this procedure and as you can see in the instructions on the left the first thing we're going to do is update our NAB data and we do that by clicking on the LVR cysts folder on the SD card open that up on our local computer in our data location our main data location we open the win FS mount folder then we copy this file the Aviation database on we'll right click copy left click once in the window below right click paste replace the file click there and my nav data is now updated next I'm going to do my MFD update so I need to eject left click on what this PC right click on my NAB SD data card eject I'm going to remove that card and insert my MFD SD card my computer for some reason I have to hit refresh before it will actually see the drive so there's my garden there's my barman SD card my MFD card double-click on that card and I'm gonna select five files in this folder the airframe info hold my control key down and select the airport directory the feature unlock safe taxi and the terrain ODB that's your obstacle database every once in a while very very rarely the terrain databases will be updated which are your base map that be mapped up in the terrain a DB and the terrain underscore 9 ast DB file everyone smile they'll be updated I think the last update was like two or three years ago but it was just updated in January this year I'm not gonna update mine right now just to save a little time because they're over a gigabyte file but when those are updated just in that one update then copy those files down as well alright now that I have them selected I right-click I right-click on any one of them left click on copy left click anywhere in the screen below right click on paste and tell it to replace the files in the destination and there we go okay that step where you're down through step three and everything has been updated now except for the flight charts in order to update the flight charts we have to open a special file called charts IMG that's located in our main data location and that file is actually a container it's a disk image file that contains the files that we need to update in order to update it we use a program a free program called OSF mount and I describe this in detail in the installation but I'll just do it quickly here for you I open up o SF mount tell it to mount new select the file that I want it to mount which is charged IMG click open and I see here it's gonna mount as my drive e on my computer I'll see that in file explorers Drive E and I do not want it to be read-only I want it to be read right because I'm gonna write to it and click OK and that is mounted I'm going to minimize that window right now just so we don't have to look at it go back to this PC remember that my bottom window is my local hard drive and you'll see that my drive e is garmin chart if i double click on that i now can see inside that charts IMG file and here's the here are the files that i need to replace in order for there to be room to replace the charts i have to click on the charts wants and delete it so i'm just going to hit my delete key yes i want to delete and that entire folder has now been deleted now I go back to my SD card left click on the same folder the FC underscore TPC hold my control key down and click on my airframe info and my feature unlock right click copy left click in the window below right click and paste and as you can see we are now copying 30 110 items so those are all of the individual charts that will show up in the trainer and I'm going to go ahead and just let this run real time so you can see how long it takes because it is a very very quick process well let this run the more shut our windows down and we'll go in and just take a look at the charts or we'll take a look at make sure that we have them while that's running I will open up my OSF mount program because I'm going to dismount this drive as soon as this is finished so I'll be prepared for that to replace the other two files that were already there next close your Explorer windows down we select the drive that we have mounted dismount it and close OSF mount down at this point all of our databases have been updated let's take a look now when this comes up you will see on my MFD it says verified chart database cycle this is a bug in the trainer software it doesn't recognize on this splash screen that the correct data has has been installed but it I'll show you that I'll show you that in just a second I'll select my profile you'll notice all the other databases are updated to the very latest very latest dates all right if you want to check the database if you want to check the databases you do the exact same thing that you would in the airplane I'm going to twist my outside knob by clicking on my right arrow the outside right arrow and go over to auxilary when I get to auxilary I'm gonna turn my right knob and go down to system status when I get to system status on the MFD click my MFD one database button and then I can scroll down once again with my outside button and look at all of my database dates I'll just scroll through these quickly and we'll go all the way down to the charts as you can see the charts have been updated to the marched February to march cycle which currently that is the that is the current cycle alright so there there you have it that's a complete database update in the next few videos I will show you exactly how to get set up to do this and walk you through those things step by step click the icon in the upper right corner of the screen for information on getting personalized help

last screen of this video you can subscribe to this Coppa University channel so you will be notified when new videos are available in this video we will cover how to update the Garmin flight charts in the trainer the trainer does not support the jeppeson charts but if you do have Jefferson charts and would like to update the Garmin charts in the trainer if you'll contact me on the copa forum by private message I may have a solution for you the flight charts are contained in a special kind of file that is a disk image file that's located in your data folder and we discussed the location of your data folder before in my case which I already have on the screen here it's the 64-bit folder and here's the file that we're going to work with right here it's called charts IMG a couple things about this file number one it contains within it the flight charts but to access them we have to open the image file in a separate program that will mount this image file as a drive letter on our computer just as if we had of insert an SD card or an external drive or whatever that's how we are going to have to access this file in the future it only takes a few seconds as you'll see the other thing is is that this file when when this file was created the flight charts were quite a bit smaller than they are today so this image filed is a set size and that size has to be increased before we can put the new font files in it and I'm going to take you through those steps here in just a minute it may seem a little confusing and all this may seem like it's a lot of steps but remember a lot of this is a one-time deal and I'll show you in a subsequent video the actual process and how fast it actually is don't let these all of these steps at first intimidate you it really is very easy the first thing that we need to do is download the program that will allow us to access this chart image file I will include a link in the courses description that will allow you to go directly to this website but the website is called OS forensics comm and they have free versions 32-bit and 64-bit versions of their program that will allow you to mount an image file download that file and install it on your computer and once you've done that you will have an icon on your desktop that will look like the one that I have right here double-click on the OSF mount program when it comes up tell it you want to mount a new virtual disk now we have to go find the file that we want to open and that's gonna be our charts dot IMG file so I'm gonna click on the little box right here and we're gonna go find that file remember on my computer mine is located under my users folder my user name is demo app data local virtual store program files 86 Cirrus perspective 1401 32-bit once again you're just see Program Files Sierra's perspective trainer 1401 and here's our file right here that we need to open the charts dot IMG so I'm gonna click on that once click open and we want to uncheck read-only because we are gonna write to this drive and as you can see here it's gonna mount this as my drive letter e once once it's mounted so in file explorer you should be able to see on my computer I'll be able to see a new lead ride and be able to see the contents of the image file click OK now as you notice in file explorer right here I'd have the new Drive now I'll just click on that quickly and just show you what it looks like inside of the D Drive which is actually the charts that IMG file you have this information which is basically what we'll be replacing here in just a little bit all right now the next thing that we need to do is increase the size of this drive so the new charts will fit in it so back on the OSF mount screen go to drive actions well first I need to click so it knows what I'm dealing with here go to drive actions and extend size enter the size that we want to add and this is in we're gonna add megabytes and I'm gonna add three hundred and fifty megabytes the size of the file that will give me plenty for future charts no matter how large they grow I don't think it'll ever get any larger than what that additional three hundred fifty megabytes will allow me to handle click OK and it says here the disk size was extended successfully but it was not possible to extend the file system I need to reformat that disk so my II drive which is the charts that IMG file needs to be formatted so click OK and we're under our drive actions once again we have format so we're gonna say format that disk we want to choose the normal file allocation table f80 I'm going to name this Garmin chart that's really not necessary but it does help as you'll see in a little bit it does help me identify it in file explorer a little bit later all right I'm going to click start once again before you do this make sure that you're just f80 file allocation table and not fat32 and start we will say okay go ahead and format it and now we have a brand new drive a chart IMG file that is big enough to hold our charts click ok we can close this down now and I'm going to open file explorer backup and let's go look at our lead ride now here's what I was saying before if I named that yarman chart I can see easily here that it's it my Garmin chart is e Drive which is actually that charts that IMG file if I click as we would expect it is empty all right my SD card on this computer is my G Drive so that's my MFD card so I'm going to right click say open a new window because remember I like to deal with two windows at once it's just a little easier for me and now I'm gonna just Conte I am going to copy but much you drive now I'm going to left-click on my FC underscore TPC folder hold my control key down and click on my air frame info XML keep my control key held down and left click on the feature unlock that so I've got these three selected right click on in either one of them and click copy click over here on my a drive which is my chart shot IMG file right click and paste now this will take a little time to copy because as you can see it's gonna copy over 3,000 charts so I will speed up through this so you don't have to watch this although it really doesn't take that long but I'll speed through it alright that took about 45 seconds on my computer once those files are copied over the files are updated so now I can just close my windows down and I want to now dismount my e Drive so go here say dismount it's closed down and I can close that down now at this time all of my flight charts are updated in the future all I'll do is come in and run OSF Mount I'll do it for you very quickly here go OSF mount mount a new Drive go mount that same Drive and it remembers my location so it's very quick open that drive and uncheck read-only because we are gonna write to it it was mounted his II drive once again pull up File Explorer and now just when I go to e Drive that's where I'll be copying the files to from my sd card and I'll just copy these three fot this folder in these two files once I finish shut that window down or shut the two windows down that I'll have open click on the drive here dismount it and shut that down that entire process takes probably two minutes at the most to do the update once you've done it a couple times click the icon in the upper right corner of the screen for information on getting personalized help with your

brought to you by Coppa University to learn more about the Cirrus owners and Pilots Association and cope University click the information icon in the upper right corner of the video at any time on the last screen of this video you can subscribe to this Coppa University channel so you will be notified when new videos are available in this video we will cover how to update all of your trainers database files except for your flight charts on my machine I'm going to be using the 64-bit data location that we covered in step 2 if you're running a 32-bit machine your data location your primary data location is C colon backslash Program Files backslash Series perspective trainer the 14 point 0 1 use that data location instead of the data location that I'll be using here the very first step is we need to update our nav data card and our MFD SD card before we can update our trainers databases once we have those updated then we can proceed with updating the databases on our local computer go down to the lower left corner right click and bring up file explorer I already have my NAB card in my card reader and that is g-drive on my particular machine here double click on that drive in your NAB data card there's a folder called LDR underscore sys double-click the file that we need is the very first file here it's the aviation database so I'm going to left click I'm sorry I'll right click click copy and then we go to our data file location and we're gonna pay set in as I said if you're running a 32-bit machine you'd go back to C Drive Program Files and then the cirrus perspective folder for 64-bit we created a shortcut to our location so I'm just going to double click that shortcut inside the data file location is a folder called when FS melt double click that folder and we're simply going to paste this file into this folder so I'm going to right click and paste says replace the file in the destination and I'll say yes now notice I actually opened a second window when I when I double clicked on my shortcut it opened a sucker second window and it's very handy I like to have the two windows open you can also do this if you don't have the shortcut and you're on the 32 bit version you haven't created a shortcut when you go to your local disk see that I'm showing down here let me move this and I'll just show you if I come down to my local disk see here instead of left clicking I can right click and say open a new window and that will do the same thing I'll open the new window and then I can have the two separate windows open alright so I now have my Aviation database copied over here it is on my local computer now I need to go back to this PC and I need to eject this SD card so I'll right-click and say eject it's ejected I can remove this SD card and insert my MFD SD card now my computer for some reason it doesn't see the card until I right click and say refresh and then it will go see the card and bring it up and my card I have named Garmin but this is my MFD card out of the plane quick double-click now the files that we want from this folder are the airport directory so I'm going to left click on that once I'm going to hold my control key down click on the feature unlock database the safe taxi and the terrain dot ODB that's the obstacle database I'm going to right-click on any one of those select copy go over and click in my window or my database directory remember I'm in the when FS mount folder right click and say paste and I'll need to tell it to replace the files in the destination and those are replaced every once in a while the base map and the terrain files will be updated and it just so happens that they were updated in this last update cycle in January of 2017 if that happens you'll also need to copy the B map bin file the terrain to a DB and the terrain underscore 9 arcsecond dot t DB i've already done that here to save time because it's a as you can see it's a fairly large file but typically you rarely rarely ever have to copy those and that is it at this point all of the database files have been updated except for the flight charts and we will cover those in the next lesson let's launch the perspective trainer and see what we have here just like in the plane it says that it's going to double check those files um we'll just click a key to continue so we don't have to wait for it and now as you can see all of my database files here have been updated except for the chart database all right as I said in the next lesson we will look at how to update the flight charts click the icon in the upper

last screen of this video you can subscribe to this Coppa University channel so you will be notified when new videos are available in this video we will cover the file and folder relocations that need to take place on a 64-bit computer before we can actually do the database updates if you have a 32-bit computer you can skip this lesson in its entirety just scroll to the end and select the step 3 icon to skip to step 3 just to explain what's going on here when the installation program first installs the trainer it places all of the data files in the C program files x86 Sara's perspective trainer version 1401 folder the very first time the trainer is run it relocates a couple of these files to an alternate location that I'll show you in a minute leaving the original files behind later when you update if you update the files in the original location it will move those as well to the alternate location and it just creates a big mess it leaves files behind it gets very confusing so the very best thing to do is in the very beginning we're going to just relocate these files we only have to do this one time and then from then on when we do the database updates we will do them in this alternate location which is actually on a 64-bit computer is your primary database location all right let's get started we'll go to the bottom left cloning the screen right click and bring up file explorer and in file explorer let's go to our drive see I'm double clicking double click on program files x86 double click on Sierra's perspective trainer 1401 this is the initial location where the installation program is stalls the fossil scroll almost to the bottom of the screen there's a lot of WAV files which are there call-outs in the program when you get down here you're gonna see charts IMG and data card IMG click on charts not ing wants hold your control key down and click on data card 1 IMG so they're both selected like this hit your delete key and delete them and I'm gonna have to give it permission so I'll say do this for all current items continue those files have already been copied to the new location when we ran the trainer for the first time and the program leaves them behind taking up almost a gigabyte of hard disk space so we're gonna delete those at this point scroll all the way back up to the top of the screen and now we're going to relocate the when FS mount folder so right-click on the folder do that one more time right click click cut I'm going back to my C Drive to the root folder of C Drive by clicking on C Drive go to the users folder double click pick your username in this case I'm using a username of demo click on app data double click if you don't see up data go back to step one and adjust your folder options double-click local double-click virtual store Program Files x86 and Sierra's perspective trainer and here's the two files that I told you had already been relocated at this point right-click and paste and we're going to say continue has been moved from its original location to this new location and from now on all of our database updates we will do in this location now you don't want to have to remember all of those steps to get to this data location later on so here's what I suggest you do let's make a shortcut on our desktop to this location the easiest way to do that is click up here in the bar and we'll click right here that highlights the entire path right click and copy alright now we've got a copy of that on our clipboard close that window down go to your desktop right-click select new shortcut what we would like to create a shortcut for with a location the item I can right click and say paste or ctrl V there's my location click next and I'm just going to name this perspective data respective data files okay now on my desktop I now have I'll move this over here with mother perspective awesome I now have a shortcut to that data file location so anytime that I want to go to that location which we'll do in the next video when we're actually updating our data files instead of going down that entire data path I can simply double click and I'm right where I need to be all right in the next lesson we're going to cover for both 32-bit and 64-bit computers updating all of the data files except for your flight charts click the icon in the upper right corner of the screen for information on

subscribe to this Coppa University channel so you will be notified when new videos are available this lesson will be a very simple basic flight from my home airport of kgm you are greenville downtown over to kgsp or career spartanburg the intent of this lesson is to show you the basic operation of the trainer and not to show you the absolute perfect IFR procedures we'll do some of that in subsequent lessons but for now I just wanted to show the operation of the trainer if you're not already familiar with it alright this flight is going to be a practice IFR flight so the first thing we do while we're sitting on the ground and obviously I'm not on the ground here I've got my trainer set at 1,300 feet which is a few hundred feet above the runway you'll see why in a little bit you take off and you're flying immediately so we're not trying to make this be a simulator so keep your simular set a few hundred feet over the airport elevation wherever you're flying from where you're taking off from and it'll just be a lot easier so first thing we would do is I look at my comm radios up here my comm - I have set on my ADA's frequency so I'll listen ATIS I get a tiss and I will swap over just as I wouldn't the plane to my ground frequency and I pick up my clearance on my ground frequency and the frequency reads something like this we're cleared to GSP as filed on departure flight heading zero three zero altitude of 3,000 feet departure frequency is one 18.8 and were to squawk five to six - so let's just take that in order first thing we want to do is put in our flight plan where we're going so we're cleared GSP I'm gonna down arrow here to move my cursor down and my plane the version I'm running anyway it's already set on the next slot but in the trainer you have to move it down we're going to K G s P enter and as you'll notice the cursor moves down automatically to the next slot since that's our only white pointer that is our only destination here I'm gonna move the cursor back up too soon top up kgsp and I'll show you why in just a little bit but I would do that right now alright next thing we're gonna set up is our heading of zero three zero which just happens to be already set up in here you will notice if I change the heading it will turn the plane immediately obviously your plane isn't gonna do that sitting on the ground but it's just the way the trainer works alright we've got our we have our zero three zero we need to put in our altitude restriction now of 3,000 feet so turn the knob go to 3,000 feet and we need to put departure frequency in a1 18.8 we have our standby frequency and I'm sorry we have our 8 s and our ground so we need to flip our comm radio up to the top top comm by the way you can set all of these things down here as well for comm we would press comm use the keypad if we want to swap from comm one to come to use this button if you want to do a frequency swap within radio you would use the button here for right now we're going to put in one one eight point eight in the airplane for me personally for whatever reason I use the knobs up here to change my frequency it's just old habits for the trainer I'll be using the buttons down here it's just simple it's simpler to use the buttons and to show the buttons we're going to go one one eight point eight so I'm going to click comm one one eight eight no need for the decimal point press ENTER and we have our we have our comm freak they set up now we're going to set our transponder frequency once again we can do it here or we can do it here this time I'm gonna do it from the keypad so transponder 5 2 6 2 and no need to press enter it knows it can only be 4 characters so at this point we are setup on the ground we would of course that our outcome door setting if it if it was different one thing that you'll find about the trainer is when you do take off when you do start flying you need to have your autopilot already on because otherwise it's going to try to fly directly to the next Waypoint so before we take off before we start any airspeed at all click your heading on the autopilot head heading mode and autopilot and if you look up in your status bar you can see we're gonna be flying in pitch mode so we'll we should stay right at 1,300 feet and heading mode so we should fly 0 3 0 and we have altitude select right now so wills for right now we're staying at the at the 13-under feet minimum speed is flashing obviously we're at 1,300 feet and we are zero not so we have a problem right now but we'll get around that just a second to start flying click your menu button twice turn your outside knob to scroll down go to airspeed and from the keypad I will enter one to zero we're gonna fly to begin with at least at 120 knots and you'll see as soon as I press enter I'll start flying autopilot Sardi on where pitch mode we're flying along at 1,300 feet to close the window down the demo mode window click my center button or you could click the menu button again so we're flying along at zero three zero and we get our frequency swap from from GSP and I'm sorry from GMU they tell us to switch over to departure so we switch over to departure and in the meantime we've started our climb we need to start our climb so I'm gonna go into vertical speed mode and I'll put a climb of 700 feet a minute now in the airplane I climb with indicated airspeed and I descend with vertical speed for the trainer it gets a little confused sometimes if you try to do that initially won't take off like this so I will put in I'll just put in my climb it's gonna maintain the same speed anyway so and we're not in a simulator we're not worried about stalling right here so we're gonna keep our climb speed at 120 so we talk to GSP and they tell us to expect the RNA to to approach and we asked if we can fly the full approach starting at Negri and they tell us to expect that so next thing we do is put our procedure in click the procedure button we're going to select approach by clicking the enter button scroll down using our outside knob - Arnav - to press ENTER to accept it and we are going to Negri once they turn us loose so we will scroll down to Negri press enter minimums I've already looked at my chart and I know my minimum so I'm gonna put those in whoops I twisted the wrong button there needs to be the inside button and press enter and my minimums for this LP V approach are is eleven hundred and sixty-four feet so I'll put that in from my keypad one one six four enter and we'll load it we haven't been cleared to Nagre yet so we'll just load that we load the approach so now we're flying along to Nagre and we are talking with we are talking with the approach controllers we know that the next frequency that we're going to get or were 99% sure that we're going to need to toggle tool on our com1 when our com1 radio that was our 200-foot call out we're 200 foot from our 3000 feet the next frequency that we're going to need is going to be tower frequency so we may as well put that in right now the easiest way to do that we are already selected on kgsp just hit our enter button press your inside button press your inside button on the controller down here scroll down to tower press Enter watch this active radio and there we are in the active radio well we also know that we need to pick up our ADIS so we will go back up to ADIS click enter that went into standby on comm to swap that over and we know we're going to need to speak to ground so we will scroll down the ground press enter and all of our comms are set up now we listen to ADIS on our com2 radio we call back to approach tell them we have a desire screen over here on our MFD we want to hit go back so we have some situational awareness we have listened to our ADIS next we will switch our comm radio over so we can just hit comm to when we land and go to ground if we're instructed to go to ground press our inside button on our comm to go up so we're ready to switch the radio to cop so we're ready to switch over to tower when we're given the clearance to tower so at this point we're flying along and approach tells us that we are cleared direct and a great we can do one of two things here it's it's a matter of personal preference one is we can go to procedure and say activate approach press enter and what that will do we'll go ahead and do it here will activate the approach is going to activate direct to Nagre now the problem is if we check our status bar every time we press a button we're still in heading mode so unless we press nav mode we're not going to Nagre so press net I press the nav mode we're going direct to Nagre now the other way to do that and it's my it's my preference is instead of saying activate approach I will use my cursor key go down the NAG reach and do a direct to de Nagre just for situational awareness it just helps me to think about where what I'm actually doing when I activate that approach it doesn't really matter one way the other but as I said for me for situational awareness I would do that one thing that I really have to work on personally that is extremely important is anytime I press a button on my autopilot controller or change anything down here I want to go back up and look at my status bar up here because there are so many times when you think you did something right or something happened and you don't quite know what but if you'll just look up there every time that you make a selection if you'll just make it a habit to look up I will literally reach up and touch that with my finger every time I make a change just to make sure that the airplane is doing what it's supposed to be doing well right now from looking at my chart I can see that I can cross I've been told to cross Negri at 3,000 feet at or above 3,000 feet so I will continue on to Nagre at 3,000 feet and once we make the turn at Negri or get close to the turnip Magri I will start the video back up there's no kneading you sitting and watching because we're just gonna fly along here happily for a few minutes to get tuned a great another good thing to do is to keep your heading bug synced with the direction you're flying so I'll do that by clicking my center of my heading knob and now now we're synched up alright we're making our turn now at Negri and we're heading into I'm up E whatever and I'm up yes as we make the turn we get a call from approach telling us that we are cleared for the Arnab to to approach when we are cleared for the approach that is our indication that we need to press our approach button on our autopilot and when we do so we should see glide path light up so we're now set up for the vertical part of our approach for our descent while we're doing this while we're flying we would also look at our chart we'll go to show chart and press enter it has the right chart brought up and if you'd like you can leave this set right on your chart personally once again I'm not a big fan of doing that I use my charts on the MFD as a backup and not my primary charts just old-school thinking but I can look I can review I should review here my missed approach I need to climb to 3,000 go direct to Aqsa B and hold so I know that my nest altitude is going to be 3,000 feet and a scroll down I'll use my button here scroll down to the bottom verify everything here there's my 1164 feet is my mist and that is at 200 feet so I want to be absolutely sure that I've got that bug properly and that I'm thinking eleven hundred and sixty-four feet take a look I'm happy with everything there I've gotten eleven hundred foot runway I think I can get down on that and we'll go back you'll see the indicator in the upper left corner we're gonna turn right in three or four seconds once again at this point I'm going to look at my indicator bar up here my status bar make sure that I'm selected the glide path is selected yet though that it's showing I don't know how many times I have forgotten to hit the approach button you turn the corner you fly right through the glide path or the glide slope and go why am I not going down very simple if you'll just look at the top you're gonna always know what's going on now once we turn the corner here we go inbound to our final approach fix we should see both in the airplane and in the trainer we should see our glide path or glide slope indicator in this case it's the glide path indicator right up at the tops or underneath it now as we fly into it we should start down we can start making speed adjustments here if we'd like at this point I would probably still be at the hundred and twenty knots as we start down I will change my speeds just by using the menu menu change the airspeed just takes a few seconds one nice thing about the trainer is you can change their speeds instantly which would be very nice if we could do that in the plane the other thing that just a personal preference the way I was taught is once we drop under 200 feet below our bugged altitude and our bugged altitude right now is 3,000 feet that is an excellent reminder at that point we're all ready flight we're already flying the glide path or the glide slope so the autopilot is no longer looking at our bugged altitude that's an excellent time to double check our missed approach altitude and set it if need be in our case there's no need to adjust it because our missed approach altitude is the same as our altitude eeeh that are bugged altitude is right here so we will just leave it set but use that as a an audible indicator to double-check your bug altitude we can see the glide path coming alive now just as we would in the plane and once we start down the glide path I will change my airspeed I'll drop down maybe 10 knots as we go down the glide path well wait a few seconds for that to hit and then I'll drop my air speed all right glide path coming in we should start down we start down I'm gonna reduce my airspeed menu menu we're still sitting on the airspeed so I'll change that to 1 1 0 enter press center button and it goes away there's my call-out at 2800 feet double check my approach plate yes 3,000 feet is where I need to be so now we'll continue on down 1164 feet is our missed approach once we hit the missed approach we're going to press art we're going to leave our autopilot on just as we should in the plane to leave the autopilot on will be half flops by then and we're gonna press our takeoff go-around button which is going to pitch us up to the optimum pitch for getting out of harm's way full throttle once we're clear the ground and we're safe and a good climb good climb speed then we can press our nav button and let the GPS take over and fly or missed approach so we'll do that we're about a thousand feet away from our 1164 if you'd like at these at this point you can start slowing down just as you would in the plane you know just make believe that you're it got your half flaps in that you're slowing down to say a hundred knots or so coming in whatever your approach speed of what you would like to have your approach speed out so I'm gonna be ready to hit the take off go around button remember it's right down here even though we can't see it so I know after practicing with the trainer that it's gonna be right here and in the plane that would be full throttle I know my boost pump is on right now I'm mixture rich or mixture appropriate for the elevation and I'm ready to go full throttle and get out of Dodge 1164 I'm about 400 feet and I'm coming in a little hot but we'll leave it like that because we know we're going around there's my wake-up call just in case I fell asleep there's 200 feet now be ready just as you would in the plane with your finger on the takeoff go-around button be ready to click in this bottom left corner of the screen right where my mouse pointer is right now because we've got to go and there we go and we take off and we're climbing alright we're to safe altitude we can click our nav button or if you want to feed off the field I'll wait just another I'll wait till about 500 feet up click my nav button now notice before I click wearing go-around mode up here we know we're not going anywhere but straight climbing up and going straight ahead so let's go to NAV and we'll go altitude select look shouldn't have done that vertical speed go back up I should have just left that alone alright I'm not going to bore you with the rest of this will conclude the lesson here the world autopilot mode now on I'm sorry we have the autopilot on we're in GPS mode we have altitude selected 3,000 feet when I click the altitude button before it change that to 1,900 feet or whatever I was so I had to go change it again and we're climbing at 600 feet a minute and we'll sit there and fly all day in the hold if need be in the next few lessons we're going to cover updating all of your databases so you can update your nav database airport directories so on and so forth and even your charts to the most current flight charts if you'd like click the icon in the upper right corner of the screen for information on getting personalized help

about the Cirrus owners and Pilots Association and cope University click the information icon in the upper right corner of the video at any time on the last screen of this video you can subscribe to this Coppa University channel so you will be notified when new videos are available this video will cover the hardware and operating system requirements for the trainer and my personal recommendations for its use here are the minimum PC system requirements taken from the trainers user's guide that's located in the root folder of the trainers CD the trainer's guide lists the requirements for single screen mode and dual screen mode but I'm only showing the dual screen mode as the trainer is useless in single screen mode to learn the perspective system you need to use all four components simultaneously the PFD the MFD the GCU 478 flight management system control panel and the GMC 705 autopilot controller just like you will be using them in the plane let's talk about each specification item first a two gigahertz processor and 512 megabytes of RAM these are very minimal requirements that any windows-based computer made in the last 10 years can be Windows 2000 or XP it's doubtful that any of you are still running a computer running 2000 or XP but if you are it's probably time to upgrade it anyway the trainer will run just fine on any current Windows operating system I'm personally running it on Windows 7 Windows 8.1 and Windows 10 you will have an installation issue running on Windows 8.1 or above but those issues are very easily worked around and we will cover them in a later video the trainer will run just fine on a Mac computer using a Windows emulator one of my computers is an iMac with a 27 inch screen with 2560 by 1440 resolution that we'll discuss later and I'm running the parallels emulator and Windows 8.1 and that's the machine I'm using to create these videos 1.5 gigabytes of hard disk space or 2.5 gigabytes with flight charts you're going to want the flight chart so figure on at least two and a half gigabytes of free hard disk space for the trainer based on my personal experience I don't like to fill my hardisk up to any more than 80 to 85% of its maximum capacity so take your remaining free hard disk space into consideration as well in a later video I'll show you how to update all your trainers data including the flight charts the most current version the trainer does not use the jeppesen charts DVD player this is going to be necessary to install the trainer from the CD DirectX DirectX is included on the CD and it will be installed automatically if it's not already installed on your computer video card monitor this is the most important hardware consideration for using the trainer effectively I'll cover them separately in just a minute for X's joystick you can use a joystick or even the keyboard to control the trainer but personally I'm not a big fan of either I find them both to be a distraction the trainers primary purpose is to help you learn the knob twisting button pushing menus and basic operation and I find that I can do this better using the mouse I am NOT going to cover the joystick or the keyboards operation but if you want to use them look in the root folder of the installation CD and you will find this document that will give you basic instructions on their use sound card this is shown as optional but the sound card and speakers or headphones will allow you to hear the call-outs exactly as you would hear them in the plane and I'm my opinion that's not an option it's mandatory it's part of learning the system now let's talk about the most important hardware component which is by far your computer's monitor the garment specs call for a monitor resolution of 1280 pixels wide by 1,024 pixels tall the PFD and the MFD and the trainer are each 1280 by 102 4 since graphics like the MFD and PFD with text small buttons and knobs become blurry when they're large or reduced you need a monitor that is 2560 pixels wide to show the MFD and PFD side by side in their native resolution with the auto pilot and flight management modules located underneath a 24-inch monitor normally has a resolution of 1920 pixels wide by 1080 pixels tall this simply isn't wide enough to display the MFD and PFD side by side without reducing their size imploring them yes it'll work but it's far from optimum and it's going to be hard on your eyes look at these actual screen shots and you'll see what I mean here's the dual display shown on a 24 inch 1920 pixel wide monitor and here's the exact display shown on a 27 inch 20 560 pixel monitor [Music] here's another dual display shown in a 24 inch 1920 pixel monitor [Music] and once again here is the same dual display shown only 27 inch 20 560 pixel monitor included links to these original screenshots in this video's description below as you can see there is a big difference in the quality of the graphics the native resolution graphics are much easier on the eyes make the controls far easier to use and they lend a much higher degree of realism to the trainer these twenty five hundred and sixty pixel wide monitors are very inexpensive you can get an Acer 27-inch monitor from Amazon for under three hundred and twenty dollars including prime shipping and there are many other excellent choices available for under five hundred dollars if your video card can't support the 2560 by 1440 resolution of the monitor you will need to upgrade it as well but video cards are also very inexpensive now that we've covered the installation requirements and my

about the Cirrus owners and Pilots Association and cope University click the information icon in the upper right corner of the video at any time on the last screen of this video you can subscribe to this Coppa University channel so you will be notified when new videos are available this video will cover the installation of the Cirrus prospective trainer version 14 point o1 if you haven't already watched the overview and the installation requirements videos I highly suggest that you do so before proceeding if you jump to the end of this video you'll find a link there to this playlist index and you can find the videos there I've already copied the CD perspective CD to my desktop you will normally run your CD from File Explorer you'll go down and right-click go to file explorer and find your CD and double click and you'll be the same place that I'm gonna be here in just a second a word of caution when you first put the CD in if you're running several of the operating systems they will load the menuing program automatically go ahead and shut that down because it will cause problems on a lot of the modern operating system so we are not going to use garments menu to avoid some problems when you double click on your CD you're going to see the folders and files shown here even you want to take note at this point that some of the files that you'll need later like the training guide and some of the other guides are right in this root folder these guides are all fairly are all very outdated if you look here you'll see the dates one will go back to 2008 you'll find some useful information in here such as how to use the keyboard and the joystick to control the trainer I don't use either as I said in the overview but if you want to come in here look at the the GFI D trainer user's guide and it's a PDF file and it'll give you instructions on how to do so to install the trainer double click on the install folder and then we're going to double click on the Cirrus perspective trainer version 1401 while we're in this folder though I'll show you quickly in a another video a little later on will show you how to update the charts to the most current version you'll notice that the charts file is actually located in this folder as well it's almost a gigabyte file it's eight hundred eight megabytes and it's located here on the city so if you ever did need another copy you can come I can get it also the terrain database is located here as well alright we're going to double click and the installation will start don't be concerned if it takes a few seconds for this to load up because it's quite slow for some reason I'm gonna agree to the terms and conditions and we're going to check flight charts because we do up the charts installed we will accept the location that it's offering us and all of the files are copied and a shortcut is going to be placed on our desktop here in just a moment you and that's all there is to the installation we are going to close all the files have been copied and at this point you can remove the CD now the interesting thing is that after the installation you're left with a single icon on your desktop which launches a single PFD and I never have quite figured out what good that does because obviously we have to run the trainer with all four of the screen showing or all the devices showing the PFD the MFD the autopilot controller and the flight management system but I'm gonna click on it just to show you what we have to begin with there is one thing on this screen that you'll want to remember and for that reason I would suggest that you go ahead and leave this icon on your desktop because it's about the only thing it's good for notice down on the bottom left corner you have your take off and go around box here this will simulate pressing your take off and go around button on your throttle so when you're practicing your missed approaches for example you can push this button it'll do exactly what it would do on the plane if you push the button when we get to the dual screen mode for whatever reason it does not show up there so you're going to have to remember this location now that being said that's the only thing that that icon is good for and if you notice this is the old Garmin g1000 it's not even a perspective that they're showing here on this single screen because obviously we don't have these buttons over on the left side we don't even have those on our perspective screens so let's close that down the next thing we have to do is we need to get our dual screen icon or our shortcut on our desktop so we can run the trainer the easiest way to do that is just to right-click down on the windows icon on the bottom go to search now I'm running Windows 8 so I get their new little search menu that comes up here if you're running Windows 7 your search will still be down the left corner you're gonna see basically the same thing but just start typing the word start st and when you get about that far you're gonna see start dual screen trainer now Windows 7 you're going to be looking right at the folder where this is located and windows 8 8.1 and 10 we need to right click on this tell it to open file location' and it will show us here where it'll show us the actual file here once again I'm going to right click and I'm going to tell it to create a shortcut it'll say do you want the shortcut to be placed on the desktop I'm going to say yes now I have a shortcut on my desktop over here I can close this down and this is optional but I will click twice here slowly and I just renamed my trainer just perspective trainer to run the trainer in the dual screen mode which is the only way that it really does you any good double-click and this mess comes up on the screen next what we need to do is rearrange these windows so they make sense so I'll just take you through the process that I would do if I'm rearranging a little slide ok I'm gonna slide this down here you slide this down here and I want to have these to the MFT and the PFD take up the entire screen and we talked about this in the system requirements and in the recommendations but I'm running a monitor that's 2560 by 1440 so I can run both of these in their native resolution and the first time around it takes just a little plane to get them exactly like you liked like you need to have them which is each of them taking up 50% of the screen but and it'll take you a couple minutes just to jockey around just like I'm doing here the good thing is is that they don't once you get these put in place it does remember the screen position so this is a one-time this is a one-time setup deal as you can see it's just tedious and it's just a little aggravating the first time around but once you get it set we'll move these up to their position I like to have them about here here and I might like to make my controller as big as I can make it obviously that makes it easier to push the buttons and find my way around there so actually I tell you what I'm going to change my mind and I'm gonna put my autopilot controller over on this side and put them all GCU for 78 on this side just makes a little more sense to me arrangers however you want them once you've done that the next thing that I want you to do is go to airframe because you can't do this once you turn you can't change the airframe once you have but once you start the system up you have to stop it and then you can change it you can change it income in the future you just have to stop so I'm going to choose an sr-22 once I've done this I'm actually ready to run the trainer for the first time so I'm going to click power power on the PFD then I'll power on the MFD now press the key to continue just like I would in the plane to save a little time and for right now we will accept the default profile notice all of the databases are way out of date we'll cover that in a future lesson I'll show you how to update all of those and I'm gonna click full on my fuel but anyway this is the way that we're set up we're sitting over in Kansas right now and the trainer is ready to ready for us to start running to turn the trainer off click the power button click the power button on the MFD and once they shut down then we can close the windows down it's not necessary it's not absolutely necessary to do that I think it's just a lot cleaner way to shut the trainer down in an orderly fashion once you do that you're back to your desktop and we're ready for our next lesson in the next lesson we're going to

https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnmB...",1541,"Feb 16, 2017",9:18,this series of instructional videos on the Cirrus prospective trainer software is brought to you by Coppa University to learn more about the Cirrus owners and Pilots Association and cope University click the information icon in the upper right corner of the video at any time on the last screen of this video you can subscribe to this Coppa University channel so you will be notified when new videos are available in this video we are going to cover the initial configuration of the trainer first my personal preference is to have my toolbar Auto hide to give me as much screen real estate as I can possibly have so in order to do that I will right-click on my toolbar select properties and select Auto hide the toolbar or taskbar click apply and close the dialog down and as you can see my toolbar or my taskbar has disappeared double-click on the trainer and as I said in the last lesson the airframe I am choosing now as a cirrus sr20 to be absolutely sure that the airframes match on both the PFD or the MFD or you will have significant issues on the trainer using the mouse if I want to use the buttons or the knobs I simply click on whatever I need to use on the concentric knobs they'll have two sets of arrows the outside arrows as you see here control the outside knob the inside arrows control the inside knob and any knob that you would normally push for example the heading knob or the coarse knob you simply click in the middle of those and they will click just like they do in the airplane the joystick you work by clicking the little arrows around the edge of the joystick and of course the keyboard the numeric keyboard the autopilot the buttons on the MFD and PFD you simply click those just that just as you would in the plane you just use the mouse instead of thee you just use the mouse instead of the buttons in the plane the very first thing that I like to do as I do in the airplane is set up my own personal profile so in order to do that let's turn these on and get them started up as you can see when we come up right now we have just the default profile it's the only profile set up we're going to go change that very first thing and we'll just accept the fuel that we have there to change the profile I'm going to turn my outside knob on the flight management system till I go to the auxilary tab then I'm going to go down to system setup click the inside button I'm going to turn the outside button to go to create click enter and enter my name I'll speed through this so you don't have to painfully sit and watch me enter my name my will press Enter once a based on current settings fine and create now if I turn the left knob and go back to the profiles I can turn my inside button and I can see my new profile has been created turn the outside button go down to that new profile select enter and it'll take it a few seconds to load my new profile and there we have the new profile loaded my inside button and we are finished with the profile I'm going to click now the outside arrow as if I was turning my outside knob and just take us back to our main map screen and now we will do our initial configuration of the trainers parameters very important button in the trainer is your menu button when the menu button is clicked twice once twice it brings up a demo mode screen where we change the parameters of the trainer itself the first screen that comes up the first group is our position screen and here we're going to use our outside knob to go down normally this is where we change our airspeed during a flight our ground speed will be calculated based on our airspeed in the wind direction we can also change our position by putting GPS coordinates in or by putting a waypoint in I will normally put my home airport of Greenville downtown airport or kg mu and so I typically start at my airport and fly out of there but on any flight you can start wherever you wherever that you would like I clicked enter and now I'm going to click my the outside arrow to go down as you can see we're taking a very quick flight from Kansas to South Carolina over on the PFD next we set our altitude I will typically set my altitude at say 500 feet above the field level remember we're not trying to make this into a simulator so I'm not trying to simulate takeoff with it so my field is about a thousand foot so we'll set this at 1500 feet when I am doing a flight I will come in here and change the air speed above next and this is very important go back to the top part of the screen by clicking your outside or by turning your outside knob with your mouse at this point where you're on the group twist the inside knob to the right twist it again go down to GPS notice also on this screen this is where you can simulate failures as well by going down one more but right now go to GPS click on enter where we're now on GPS solution twist the inside knob and go down to 3d differential fix press enter on your GPS inside knob click it once and you'll be on loss if you don't make those two changes you're not going to be able to fly LPB approaches your glide path isn't going to work once we've done that I'm going to go back up to group and just show you once again I twist the inside knob and there's my group menu options once we've adjusted these settings our trainer is ready to be used I'm going to click the menu button one more time and at this point if you would like you can adjust your screens any way that you normally have them in the in your airplane that you're comfortable with for me I would probably turn on my topo button click my Airways twice so I'm showing low Airways click back and I'm happy with that and I may change my end sets may have my nearest box up whatever makes you comfortable whatever you're used to in your plane but at this point the trainer is ready to be used next we're going to just power off shut the trainer down close our windows alright in the next lesson we're going to cover the basic operation of the trainer and take a very simple flight to see how the buttons and the menus work in flight click the icon in
